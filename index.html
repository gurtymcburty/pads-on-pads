# Postflop Mastery: Playing In Position

## Introduction

Most poker education gets the order wrong. You can't build profitable preflop ranges if you're bleeding chips postflop. When solvers calculate that king-seven suited is a profitable open, they assume you'll play it perfectly after the flop. If you don't, that "profitable" open becomes a losing play. This chapter focuses on the most frequent situation you'll face in poker: you raise from position, the big blind calls, and you need to navigate the flop, turn, and river. Master these spots, and you've mastered the foundation of tournament poker.

## Stop Memorizing, Start Understanding Mechanics

For years, instructors memorized bet sizing charts: 20% on king-high boards, 25% on ace-high boards, 85% on nine-high boards. This approach fails because it focuses on outputs rather than inputs. The breakthrough comes from understanding *why* certain sizes work.

Here's the key insight: when you want your opponent to fold or become indifferent with overcards that lack backdoor draws, you need a small sizing—around one-third pot. Whether that's 23%, 25%, or 30% doesn't matter. What matters is achieving the strategic goal: making hands like queen-high without draws unprofitable to continue.

This mechanical understanding liberates you from rote memorization and allows you to adapt to different opponents and stack depths. Position isn't just about acting last—it's about controlling pot size, realizing equity, and exploiting the fundamental asymmetry between your range and your opponent's capped range.

## Why Position Matters More at 20BB

At 20 big blinds effective, the big blind faces brutal mathematics across all board textures. On average, they hold only 35-37% equity against your range, and their equity realization is terrible—they can't see turns and rivers without paying premium prices.

Consider this: you open ace-six offsuit, they defend seven-eight suited. The board comes ace-jack-nine. Even with 30% equity (gutshot and backdoor flush draw), they must fold to your continuation bet. You've denied them the chance to realize that equity. This happens constantly when you're in position at shallow stacks.

The positional advantage compounds because your strong hands protect your bluffs by threatening coolers, you control when the hand ends, your opponent must navigate multiple streets with imperfect information, and stack-to-pot ratios favor aggression over pot control.

## Board Texture Hierarchy

Not all boards deserve the same treatment. You can group flops into distinct categories, each requiring a different betting approach:

**Three-Broadway Boards (K-Q-J, A-K-Q)**

These boards call for near-100% continuation betting from all positions. Your range connects too well to ever give free cards. Even from the button with a wide opening range, you're betting 69-96% of the time because you have all the suited kings, queens, and aces while your opponent has mostly suited connectors and small pairs that completely missed.

Use 60-75% pot sizing on these coordinated boards. You're making queen-x and ten-x indifferent, forcing them to fold hands with genuine equity like king-ten offsuit or queen-nine suited. Don't worry about "balancing" multiple sizes—pick one exploitative size that accomplishes your goal and execute it relentlessly.

**Two-Broadway Boards (K-Q-5, K-J-7)**

Here's where position matters dramatically. From early position, bet 96% of the time with medium to large sizing. From the button, bet only 69% because your wider range includes seven-six suited and suited connectors that have zero claim to king-queen boards.

Use 30-50% pot as your default. You're targeting their offsuit broadways (king-jack offsuit, queen-ten offsuit) that completely whiffed. When you bet and they fold these hands, you've generated immediate profit without risking much.

**Low Boards (7-5-4, 6-3-2, 8-6-3)**

These boards present the highest checking frequencies across all positions—often 30-50%. This contradicts newer players' instincts to "always c-bet." The mechanics: these boards crush the big blind's calling range. They defended hands like five-four suited, seven-six suited, and various suited connectors specifically because low cards keep them alive.

When you do bet, use small sizes (25-30% pot) targeting marginal hands like ace-high or king-high without backdoor draws. Check back frequently with your own marginal made hands—like pocket nines on seven-five-four—because you're not getting called by worse very often, you're not folding out better very often, and pot control becomes valuable as stacks shrink.

**Disconnected High Cards (K-8-3, Q-9-4, A-8-5)**

These boards demand different approaches based on their specific texture. On ace-eight-five type boards, go big immediately with 60-75% pot. You fold out all weak fives, hands like five-four become snap-folds with no backup equity, and you make pocket sixes through nines fold.

After betting big on the flop, go small on blank turns (30-35% pot). This counterintuitive sizing works because you already folded out weak pairs on the flop. Small bets make remaining eight-x fold while allowing you to barrel two streets with ace-x and still get value.

On king-high disconnected boards without an ace, simplify to 33% pot range bets. Your opponent checks to you with a condensed range, and you're efficiently folding out better hands while building pots with your value.

**Dangerous Connected Boards (T-9-8, 9-8-7)**

Use large sizing (60-75% pot) on these textures. You're denying equity to gutshots, pair-plus-draws, and overcards. At 20BB effective, you can't afford to let eight outs see a turn card cheaply. Your overpairs face nightmares on any ace, king, queen, or ten. They need protection NOW.

## The Ace-High Paradox

Ace-high boards create fascinating strategic splits based on the accompanying cards:

**Ace-Low Boards (A-3-2, A-4-2)**

Go small—30-33% pot on the flop. Your opponent has too many hands that won't fold: all their three-x has a pair plus gutshot, all their two-x has a pair plus wheel draw potential, and they defend hands like five-four offsuit that make two live cards with draws.

The EV difference between bet sizes is minimal here. Simplify: just bet small with your entire range, including complete air with backdoor equity.

**Ace-Medium Boards (A-8-5, A-8-4, A-9-5)**

These are your premium bet-large boards. Go big immediately—60-75% pot. You fold out all weak fives immediately, hands like five-four and five-three become snap-folds with no backup equity, and you make pocket sixes through nines fold—a massive win.

Execute with all your ace-x for value, pocket pairs 7-7 through K-K (they dominate calling range and need protection), and backdoor draws that block ace-x like nine-eight suited or ten-eight suited.

**Ace-Broadway Boards (A-K-2, A-Q-J)**

On ace-king-x boards specifically, range bet 60% pot. Your range advantage is crushing (72% equity vs. 27%). Check back only hands with no incentive to bet: pocket queens and jacks (no protection needed, blocks nothing useful), weak king-x like king-eight or king-seven (doesn't get called by worse), and occasional pure bluff candidates with no equity.

On more connected ace-broadway boards like ace-queen-jack, the solver sometimes suggests 90% pot bets, but against humans, simplify to 60% pot. You'll still fold out king-nine, queen-nine type hands, and you can comfortably barrel two streets with your ace-x and draws.

## Monotone Boards: The Small Bet Revolution

On all-one-suit boards, your strategy depends critically on the height of the cards and who holds the flush blockers.

**High Monotone Boards (K♣T♣8♣, J♣T♣8♣)**

When the flush cards connect with your range more than your opponent's, bet 21-30% pot with nearly your entire range. You're betting all top pairs for thin value, all second pairs for thin value, weak hands like nine-eight because folding out ace-queen offsuit is valuable, and even weak pairs like pocket sevens to charge opponent's ace-high gutshots.

Check only your worst offsuit ace-high hands that have no equity when called and minimal fold equity. Continue small (21-30%) on most turn cards, with two critical exceptions:

When a fourth flush card arrives, check nearly 100% of your range. When a connecting broadway turn arrives (like a queen on king-ten-eight), increase bet frequency and size—now your ace-jack gutshots become excellent bluffs.

**Low Monotone Boards (K♣4♣2♣, Q♣4♣3♣)**

Check 60-80% of your entire range on the flop. These boards hit your opponent's suited wheel cards and small suited connectors—exactly what button calling ranges contain. You have a flush only 1% of the time while they have one 10% of the time.

When you do bet (aim for 20-40% frequency), bet 30% pot with ace-high for protection, your rare nut flushes for value, and occasional weak underpairs as bluffs. Crucially, slow-play most medium-strength flushes—you're not ahead of much when called on a flop bet.

## Stack Depth Transforms Strategy

Your continuation betting approach must adapt dramatically as effective stacks change:

**At 20BB: Maximum Aggression**

Stack off with any pair plus draw. Donk-shove from out of position 35-40% of the time on connected boards. The pot is worth fighting for aggressively, and you're denying equity from hands that would otherwise realize value cheaply.

**At 40BB: The Danger Zone**

This is the awkward middle ground. You face difficult SPR situations where getting check-raised often commits you to the pot. Introduce 25-33% pot bets with hands that have equity but can't call a shove. Still bet 50% pot with your strongest continuing hands.

**At 100BB: Sophisticated Maneuvering**

Your checking frequency explodes. On ace-high boards, check 36-50% depending on texture. You can't profitably c-bet every ace when called—your offsuit ace-queen, ace-jack, and ace-ten don't barrel three streets well out of position.

Use two bet sizes: 25-30% pot for merged ranges, and 60-75% pot for polarized spots. The deeper you are, the more you can maneuver through complete game trees, extracting maximum value from dominated hands while allowing opponents to make mistakes across multiple streets.

## Turn Play: Where Good Players Become Great

After you've continuation bet the flop and gotten called, the turn is where elite players dramatically increase their win rate. The secret isn't memorizing turn cards—it's understanding when your range advantage persists and when it evaporates.

**The Overbet Principle**

On specific turn cards that complete straights or bring high cards to dynamic boards, launch massive overbets (150-200% pot). On ace-jack-four boards that bring a ten, you should jam or bet huge. Your opponent lacks king-queen offsuit and suited (would three-bet preflop), lacks ace-jack offsuit (would check-raise flop), and lacks many pocket pairs (same reason).

You have all the king-queen, all the overpairs, all the ace-jack combinations. Execute this with all your actual nuts, high-equity draws and second pairs like king-six or queen-eight offsuit, and weak gutshots like nine-seven or nine-eight.

**Total Blank Undercards**

When a deuce or trey peels on the turn after you bet a high-card flop, fire 2x pot with complete air. Your opponent hasn't improved—he doesn't have eight-two, four-two, or ten-two in his range. Your overpairs become theoretical nuts because he would have check-raised better on the flop.

**The Board-Pairing Turn Check**

This is counterintuitive but crucial: when you continuation bet small on the flop and the middle card pairs on the turn (like king-seven-three-seven), checking back with your entire range is often highest EV. Your small flop bet already folded out blocks of unpaired hands like queen-ten and jack-ten offsuit.

By the turn, your opponent's range has condensed around three categories: seven-x (which crushed you), king-x (which will pay you anyway), and dead air-ball bluffs that desperately need to bluff rivers to win. When you check back, you avoid disasters against trips, induce bluffs from dead hands, and extract maximum value when they have that king by letting them bet the river themselves.

**The Turn Nudge**

When you called a big flop bet from out of position and a blank turn arrives that improves your range more than theirs, lead 10-20% pot with most of your range. On boards like king-seven-three that become king-seven-three-five, you suddenly have 60% equity instead of 42%.

Lead for 15% pot with all your seven-x, pairs that need protection, weak top pairs that don't want to check-call larger bets, and some of your straight draws. Your opponent theoretically should call 80% of their range at this price—they won't. When they overfold (and they will), you're printing money with minimal risk.

## River Mastery: The Money Street

The river is where the largest pots and the biggest mistakes converge. Your bet sizing here determines whether you extract maximum value or leave chips on the table.

**The Small River Bet Trap**

When you reach the river with medium-strength hands after a bet-check-bet sequence, the instinct is to bet small for "thin value." Resist this urge. After checking the turn, you're capped. If you reopen action with a small bet, your opponent can turn marginal hands into raises, and suddenly your tiny profit evaporates.

Use 67%+ pot sizing when betting rivers after checking turns. Bet only hands strong enough to justify this size—basically betting for value/protection, not trying to induce crying calls. Check down your medium-strength holdings unless you have specific exploitative reasons to bet.

**The Polarization Power Play**

After betting flop and turn, your river range should be polarized between strong hands and bluffs. Use two sizes maximum: around 67% pot and all-in. Never use 33% or "blocking bet" sizes.

On boards like ace-nine-four rainbow where you bet flop small and a king turn completes some straight draws, bomb blank rivers with pot-sized bets or all-ins. You have all the nuts, they're capped with pairs and draws. Bluff with your king-four, queen-three hands—pure equity plus blockers. You're making queen-ten fold, king-nine fold, even some weak kings fold.

**Deep Stack River Overbets**

At 60+ big blind stacks in 3-bet pots, extracting maximum value requires aggressive pot-building on earlier streets and willingness to shove massive river overbet sizes. If you use standard bet sizes throughout the hand, you'll reach the river with 40+ big blinds behind but only a 15-20 big blind pot.

With premium holdings on dynamic boards, use larger flop and turn sizes to build a pot where an all-in river shove becomes feasible. On boards where you hold the nuts after betting twice, shove approximately 1.8x pot—don't settle for pot-sized bets when you can get the entire stack in.

**Blocker Theory in River Bluffing**

Your river bluffs should block the hands that call while unblocking the hands that fold. On paired boards like ace-king-queen-jack-jack in 3-bet pots, pocket nines with the flush suit become premium bluffs at 90%+ frequency.

When you jam with a club in your hand, you block opponent's check-back flush draws, you block their calling bluff-catchers like ace-nine of clubs or king-nine of clubs, you unblock their folding range (weak aces, weak kings), and even when called, you're not drawing completely dead.

**The Check-Raise River**

When you're out of position and your opponent checks back favorable turn cards, consider check-raising river rather than leading. After checking the turn, they've capped their range. They'll frequently have bluff-catchers: underpairs to the board, weak made hands, or missed draws they gave up on.

By checking instead, you allow them to bet their entire range—both value hands they would've checked behind your lead and bluffs they turn marginal hands into. Now you can check-raise huge and get called by worse.

## The Three-Bet Pot Dimension

When you're playing in position after 3-betting, the pot is already inflated and mistakes are magnified. With 16-18 big blinds in the middle, every sizing and strategy decision creates massive EV swings.

**Shallow Stack 3-Bet Pots (40BB)**

At 40BB effective in 3-bet pots, simplification is key. On connected middle boards like ten-nine-seven or jack-nine-seven, eliminate all bet sizes except jam and check. Your opponent has plenty of nines, sevens, eights, and gutshots, but you have more top pairs, overpairs, and two-overcards-plus-draws.

When you jam 32BB into an 18-chip pot, your opponent faces an impossible situation. They must call with jack-seven (pair and gutshot), nine-eight (pair and gutshot), even seven-six (pair and gutshot) because these hands have too much equity to fold. But they must fold hands like king-queen offsuit, queen-jack offsuit—hands with real equity but not enough to call an overbet.

On dry ace-high boards like ace-six-two or ace-nine-two, bet 30% pot with 85%+ of your range. These boards murder your opponent's calling range—they've called with hands like king-queen, queen-jack, jack-ten offsuit that completely whiff. Even your worst hands like pocket fives benefit from betting because you force folds from better hands while your opponent calls with worse.

**Deep Stack 3-Bet Pots (100BB)**

At 100BB effective, your strategy transforms completely. You can't simply bet and stack off with top pair anymore—you need to think in terms of complete game trees and whether you can comfortably commit your entire stack across different runouts.

On low ace boards like ace-three-two or ace-four-three, check aggressively—even strong ace-x hands like ace-king check around 50% of the time. Even when you bet and get called with ace-king, many turn cards are problematic. If another low card comes or a straight completes, you're checking. If a ten or jack arrives, you're still not comfortable value-jamming the river on most runouts.

On ace-broadway boards like ace-king-two or ace-queen-three, use one size around 50-60% pot rather than trying to mix between multiple sizes. The EV difference is minimal (less than 1% of pot), but the implementation burden of using multiple sizes is enormous.

On boards like king-queen-five or king-jack-four at 100BB, you can bet 90%+ of your range for a small size (around 30% pot). Your pocket pairs are all comfortable betting (even nines and tens), you force immediate folds from many hands with equity against you, and you maintain board coverage with strong hands when called.

**The Broadway Board Overbet Play**

On coordinated broadway boards in 3-bet pots like jack-ten-five or jack-ten-three with a flush draw present, consider shoving all-in on the flop with around 15% of your range. Your shoving range consists of immediate overpairs that need protection (queens, kings), top pairs wanting maximum value (ace-jack), premium straight draws (ace-queen, ace-king), and strategic bluffs that block calls (king-queen offsuit, ace-queen offsuit).

When you shove ace-queen or king-queen on jack-ten-five with a flush draw, you fold out all ten-x without a jack or queen kicker, weaker flush draws, gutshots without additional equity, and all underpairs except possibly pocket tens.

On two-high-card boards like king-queen-five or king-jack-six, use 238% pot sizing (double pot) with your entire polarized range. Your value hands (all strong top pairs like king-queen, king-jack, ace-king) want maximum value. Your bluff hands should be bottom pair (all five-x combinations on king-queen-five) because when you bet 238% pot with six-five suited, you make fold all pocket pairs, second pairs without strong kickers, better backdoor draws, and gutshots without additional equity.

## Position-Specific Adjustments

Your continuation betting strategy must vary dramatically based on your opening position:

**Early Position vs Button**

From early position, your range is tight and strong (ace-queen+, pocket sixes+, strong suited broadways). You can play aggressively with mixed approaches: big bets (66% pot) at 20% frequency on favorable boards, small bets (30% pot) at 34% frequency as your default, and checking 46% to trap and balance.

On three-broadway boards, you dominate. The button's flatting range includes many suited connectors and medium pairs that miss completely. You have all the strong kings, queens, and aces. Bet big and frequently.

**Cutoff vs Button**

From cutoff, disaster strikes. You're opening wider (35% range vs 15% from early position), but the button's flatting range is equally strong. Critically, you now have an equity disadvantage (49% vs 51%) AND terrible equity realization (91% vs 98%).

Embrace checking as your primary weapon: check 80% frequency (compared to 46% from early position). When you do bet, be highly selective—only when you have clear range advantages on specific board textures.

You can't profitably c-bet because when you bet, you're usually value-betting against worse (low EV) or bluffing against better (negative EV). The button can float profitably with backdoor draws and position. You can't barrel multiple streets effectively—you're too shallow to give up on turns but too deep to commit on flops.

**Hijack vs Button**

The hijack represents the transition point. You're opening moderately wide (22% range), maintaining slight equity advantage (51%), and achieving reasonable equity realization (95%). Use moderate aggression with selectivity: focus c-betting on boards where your range has clear advantages (high cards, paired boards), check frequently on middle-connected boards where the button's suited connectors connect well, and use small bets as your default.

## The Donk Betting Revolution

When you're out of position in the big blind after defending against a raise, you're not required to check to the preflop aggressor. On certain boards—particularly low, connected textures—leading with a small bet creates devastating problems for your opponent.

**When to Donk Lead**

On boards like six-five-four, seven-five-three, or seven-six-four rainbow at 20BB, lead 100% of your range for 30% pot. Your opponent's range lacks these low cards entirely—no seven-six suited from early position, no eight-seven suited. Meanwhile, you have all the seven-x, six-x, five-x combinations.

When you lead small, your opponent should defend 85-90% theoretically. They'll actually fold closer to 40-50%. Even hands with backdoor equity like king-ten of spades (has backdoor spade draw) are supposed to call 50% of the time. King-jack of spades—a backdoor flush draw on a dry board—is supposed to raise. This simply won't happen.

**Turn Play After Donk Leading**

After leading flop and getting called, your turn approach depends on the turn card. Use small turn bets (30-40% pot) on high cards (queen, king, ace). Your opponent's continuing range contains many broadway combinations—king-jack, king-queen, queen-jack, ace-ten. These hands immediately fold to a small turn bet when the board stays low.

Use big turn bets (60-70% pot) on low cards (two, three, four, five, six). When the board pairs or another low card hits, bet bigger. Your seven-x, six-x, five-x hands want to get money in, and your opponent's high cards have fewer outs.

**At Deeper Stacks**

As stacks deepen to 30BB and beyond, your donk betting strategy needs recalibration. At 30BB on six-five-four, equilibrium suggests donking drops from 81% to 65%. But here's the key: when opponents fail to raise correctly (and they won't), you can maintain nearly the same aggression.

At 30BB, optimal play demands your opponent dramatically increase their bluff-raising frequency with hands like ace-jack offsuit, king-jack, even queen-jack. They won't. When you remove these theoretical raises from their strategy, suddenly your entire range can lead profitably again.

## The 15BB Shallow Stack Shift

At 15 big blinds and below, flop dynamics flip completely. What worked at 20-30 big blinds becomes obsolete. Being out of position becomes an advantage when shallow—by donk-shoving the flop, you force opponents to fold equity while you realize yours.

**Maximum Donk-Shove Frequencies**

At 10BB on connected boards like seven-six-five rainbow, donk-shove 35% of hands. Your shoving range includes all five-x, six-x, seven-x, eight-x pairs (except premium two-pairs/sets for trapping), gutshots like king-four, queen-four, jack-four, and open-enders with overcards.

When you shove, opponents fold 25% despite getting excellent pot odds. You're denying equity to hands like jack-nine, ten-nine, and ace-high that would otherwise realize value cheaply.

At 12BB, counterintuitively, your donk-shove frequency increases to 38%. Why? Opponents now fold 40% instead of 25%. Getting worse pot odds, they release dominated hands like jack-nine (two overcards plus straight draw) that crush your jack-four when called.

At 15BB, donk-shove frequency drops to 33% as future streets regain importance. On dynamic boards like eight-seven-six, reduce shoving drastically (down to 18%). Opponent's range contains too many offsuit combos like ten-nine that dominate your sixth pair.

**Board Texture Adjustments at Shallow Stacks**

On king-high boards like king-seven-five at 15BB, use small 20-25% pot bets instead of shoving. When you hold a king, you're not vulnerable—opponents' overcards are mostly dead. You want value, not folds.

Lead small with all king-x (unblocking queens, jacks, tens), middle pairs like seven-x, six-x for protection, and trap premium two-pairs and sets. When you check king-high boards, opponents check back 75% of their range. Leading small forces them to continue or fold with hands that would otherwise realize equity freely.

## Common Exploitable Patterns

Understanding population tendencies allows you to deviate profitably from balanced strategies:

**Opponent Checks Too Much in Position**

When your opponent checks back the flop in position on boards where they should bet 80-95% of the time, they've revealed a critical weakness. They're checking "tier 3" hands—ace-high, king-high, underpairs, weak gutshots—because these hands feel "medium" to them.

This creates a narrow, honest checking range you can demolish with aggressive turn probes. Bet 30-40% pot with any two cards that have equity—suited connectors, gutshots, overcards, bottom pair. You're exploiting their range weakness, not your hand strength.

**Opponent Overfolds to Small Bets**

Most players dramatically overfold to turn leads because they get "stunned" by unexpected aggression, imagine you have nutted hands (you don't), and don't calculate pot odds correctly for small bets.

When you notice opponents folding hands like king-queen or jack-ten to your 15% turn leads, expand your leading range to 100% of hands, reduce your river value bet sizing (you already got extra value on the turn), and never size up—just keep betting small.

**Opponent Range-Bets Ace-High Boards**

When your opponent range-bets ace-high boards after missing their c-bet, they're usually sitting on unimproved broadway cards. Use small check-raises (2.3-2.5x) with your entire polarized range: aces, pocket pairs for protection, and straight draws wrapping the low card plus backdoor flush draws.

Your opponent theoretically should call with hands like king-eight suited with backdoor flush draw—they won't. Even when they should defend 85-90% of the time, they fold closer to 60-70%. Capitalize ruthlessly.

## The Complete In-Position Strategy

Your positional advantage compounds across streets, but only when you understand the mechanical principles driving each decision:

1. **Board texture determines sizing through opponent structure**—what hands are you targeting to fold, and what size makes them indifferent?

2. **Stack depth dictates strategic priorities**—at 20BB you're applying maximum pressure immediately; at 100BB you're maneuvering through complete game trees

3. **Range advantage matters more than specific holdings**—think range vs range, not hand vs hand

4. **Position creates compounding edges**—you control pot size, realize equity efficiently, and gain critical information before committing chips

5. **River play determines final EV**—use large, polarized bet sizes to extract maximum value and generate optimal fold equity

When you integrate these principles, position transforms from a vague advantage into a systematic edge. You're not guessing at bet sizes or playing "feel poker"—you're executing a coherent strategy built on mechanical understanding of how ranges interact across different board textures and stack depths.

The path to postflop mastery isn't about memorizing thousands of board textures. It's about understanding core mechanical principles and applying them consistently. When you check seven-five-four from the button, you're not following a chart—you're recognizing that your range doesn't connect and pot control matters. When you bet large on king-nine-four, you're not executing a preset plan—you're polarizing because your range advantage demands it.

Study the mechanics. The boards will take care of themselves.

# Chapter 2: PKO Strategy with Alex Theologis

## Overview

Progressive Knockout tournaments fundamentally change poker strategy in ways most players dramatically underestimate. Every opponent carries a bounty on their head—typically 50% of their buy-in—and when you eliminate them, you immediately collect half that bounty while the other half gets added to your own head. This creates powerful economic incentives that override traditional chip-EV thinking and soften the brutal ICM pressure that paralyzes play in standard tournaments.

The critical insight: bounties don't give you license to gamble recklessly. Instead, they require surgical precision—expanding ranges intelligently when you cover opponents, tightening drastically when covered, and constantly recalibrating as stack sizes shift. Master these principles and you'll exploit the field's tendency to either play far too conservatively or punt off chips in marginal spots.

## Core Principles

**The Bounty Value Framework**

In standard 50% PKO tournaments, a starting bounty equals roughly 25% of a starting stack—about 12.5 big blinds if you start with 50 blinds. This value doesn't stay static. As players bust, the bounty pool depletes slower than the player pool, making each remaining bounty progressively more valuable. By the time 50% of the field remains, that starting bounty is worth 29% of a starting stack. At 25% of the field, it jumps to 32.5%. At heads-up, it caps at 50%.

This escalation matters enormously. A player with accumulated bounties becomes an increasingly attractive target as the tournament progresses, even as their chip stack shrinks. That short stack with 10 blinds who's accumulated 3 starting bounties? Their bounty alone is worth roughly 10 blinds—you're essentially getting 2:1 on a flip.

Before making any PKO adjustment, ask: "Is this bounty actually significant?" A bounty worth less than two big blinds barely matters. A bounty worth 10+ big blinds changes everything. Most players overadjust for tiny bounties and underadjust for massive ones.

**The Quick Calculation Method**

You need a fast way to calculate equity adjustments in real-time. Here's the formula: divide the number of starting bounties your opponent has by their number of starting stacks. This gives you an equity reduction percentage:

- Value of 0.5 = ~3% equity reduction
- Value of 1.0 = ~5.4% equity reduction
- Value of 1.5 = ~7.4% equity reduction
- Value of 2.0 = ~9% equity reduction

If someone jams 20 blinds with a starting bounty (0.4 starting stacks with 1 starting bounty), you divide 1 by 0.4 for a value of 2.5, meaning roughly 10% equity reduction from a chip-EV calculation. You can profitably call significantly wider than in a freezeout.

**Coverage is Currency**

Everything in PKO strategy revolves around one question: Who covers whom? When you cover an opponent, you have direct access to their bounty through stackoff situations. This creates immediate value that doesn't exist in chip-EV poker. Your strategic approach should revolve around coverage—when you cover multiple players, you can apply maximum pressure. When you're the shortest stack covering nobody, you need to gamble more aggressively than ICM alone would suggest.

Position yourself to exploit big bounties and avoid strong regulars. Sitting directly left of large bounty holders gives you last action to attack their opens with isolation raises and reshoves. Simultaneously, avoid sitting directly behind the strongest regulars to minimize playing out of position in marginal spots. Think of seat selection as creating lanes of attack: you want highways to big bounties and detours around dangerous players.

**ICM Pressure Gets Cut in Half**

On PKO final tables, your risk premium is approximately half what it would be in a freezeout. The prize pool split between regular prizes and bounties means you can stack off significantly wider, defend blinds more aggressively, and play closer to chip-EV. The fear of busting that paralyzes freezeout play matters much less when half the prize pool gets distributed through bounties regardless of finish position.

When bounties are worth \$4,000 and the difference between 9th and 8th is \$1,000, traditional pay jump considerations become nearly irrelevant. Knocking out one player can vault you multiple pay positions while dramatically improving your chip position.

**Suited Hands Over High Cards**

When you're the big stack covering the table, your opening range expansion comes almost entirely from suited connectors and suited gappers—not offsuit Broadway hands. Why? Queen-8 offsuit gets dominated postflop when opponents call with Queen-10, Queen-Jack, and Ace-Queen. You can't stack anyone with a dominated hand. But 6-4 suited? That flops two pairs, flush draws, and straight draws that your opponents' big cards can't see coming. Suited hands give you board coverage and let you apply pressure without getting yourself crushed.

**Linear Aggression When Covered**

When facing a covering stack, your three-betting and shoving strategies become remarkably linear. You're not trying to make opponents fold—they won't fold enough because they can eliminate you. Instead, you're building pots with your genuinely strong hands. This completely inverts normal poker strategy where you balance value with bluffs designed to fold out equity.

## Key Strategies

### Playing the Big Blind When You Cover

**Against a Standard Open**

When you cover an opener and they have a significant bounty, you can profitably jam dramatically wider than intuition suggests. Consider a spot where the button opens 2.5x with 35 blinds and a starting bounty worth 13 blinds. Even if they call reasonably wide (pairs, strong Ax, suited broadways), you can profitably jam any pair, any ace, suited kings down to K8s, suited queens, and most broadways.

The mistake players make is treating this like a freezeout and timidly calling or folding. The bounty creates a massive pot odds overlay. Against tighter opponents who fold too much, you print money with near any-two-card jams.

**Against a Limp**

When the small blind limps and you cover them with a substantial bounty in play, your aggression should skyrocket—but only if they're limping wide. If a 25-blind stack with a 5-blind bounty limps a wide range (50%+), you can jam nearly any two cards. But if they limp tight (premium hands only), you must tighten up considerably since they'll call wider.

The critical factor is their limp range width, not just the bounty size. Always mentally estimate: "Is this player limping everything or just hands they want to see flops with?"

**Against an Open and a Call**

This creates the most profitable jamming scenario. When someone opens, another player calls, and you cover both with dead money in the pot, go absolutely wild. In a typical spot where the hijack opens, the button calls, and both have starting bounties, you can profitably jam 30%+ from the big blind: any pair, any ace, suited kings, suited queens, most broadways.

The button's dead money is the key. They rarely have a hand strong enough to overcall your jam, so you're essentially playing heads-up against the opener but getting massively improved pot odds from the button's call. Most players miss this spot entirely or play far too conservatively.

**Against a Short Stack Jam**

When a 10-blind stack jams with a 9-blind bounty, you're getting absurd odds. Call 75%+ of hands—fold only the absolute worst garbage like 72o, 83o, 92o.

The counterintuitive finding: the jammer should actually jam quite tight. In freezeouts, a 10-blind stack jams wide because they have fold equity. In PKOs, they get called so wide that their fold equity evaporates. They should jam strong hands that perform well against calling ranges rather than high-card hands that flop well. Prefer TT over JTs, for example.

**Defending Against Opens When Covering**

When the button raises and you cover them, your strategy depends entirely on their stack size:

Against 50+ BB opponents, you three-bet a tight, linear range and call an absurdly wide range—literally 85-90% of hands. You're folding only pure garbage (7-2 offsuit, 8-3 offsuit, bottom 10-15%). Even hands like 10-8 offsuit become calls because the bounty overlay when you stack them on any reasonable board makes continuing profitable.

Against 30-40 BB opponents, most players overcomlicate things. You shouldn't be three-betting Ace-King here—you should still flat it. Why? Because the button's range is tight enough (around 50% instead of 65%) that three-betting Ace-King just makes them fold all the dominated offsuit Broadway cards you'd love to play against. Flat it, keep their range wide, and use position plus hand strength to win a big pot postflop.

Against 20-30 BB opponents, shift to heavy shoving, but shove linearly. You're not shoving Ace-2 offsuit (weak, blocks their calling range). You're shoving Ace-6 suited through Ace-9 suited. You're not shoving King-6 offsuit (gets dominated). You're shoving pocket pairs and suited Kings. The pattern: shove hands that perform well in multiway all-ins, not hands that only work if everyone folds.

Against any stack when they open 65%+, you defend 100% of your range. Every single hand. Even 9-2 offsuit calls. The bounty overlay combined with position and stack coverage makes every hand profitable.

### Jamming as the Big Stack

**Near the Bubble**

When you're a big stack approaching the bubble covering a medium stack, ICM pressure on them is enormous while the bounty reduces your own risk premium. In a spot where you're on the button with 100 blinds and the big blind has 22 blinds with a starting bounty, you can jam 65%+ of hands.

Even if the big blind should theoretically call wide (KTo+, Q9s+, A5o+, 77+), most players call far too tight due to ICM fear. Adjust to reality: if they're folding hands like A9o and 88, jam even wider—close to any two cards. Only avoid complete trash like 72o.

When you flatten dramatically wider as the button covering everyone, surgical precision matters about which hands. All suited hands down to 4-2 suited, 5-2 suited, Queen-3 suited become calls. Even 10-9 offsuit becomes a call against tight early position ranges. You're defending around 30% when covered opponents raise from late position—possibly wider when you also cover both blinds.

What doesn't expand: You're not opening Queen-8 offsuit, King-7 offsuit, or other dominated trash from early position just because you're deep. Your under-the-gun range might open from 20% to 26%—not exactly revolutionary. The suited hands (5-3 suited, 6-4 suited, 7-5 suited) enter your range, but King-10 offsuit doesn't even become pure.

**With Multiple Big Bounties at the Table**

When short stacks with huge bounties (3-5x starting bounty) sit at your table, adjust your strategy toward preservation. Don't gamble unnecessarily against other big stacks when a valuable bounty is one double-up away from being in your range.

This is a future-EV consideration: maintaining your big stack to hunt the bounty-laden short stack is worth more than a marginal +EV gamble against another big stack.

### Jamming as the Short Stack

**The Counterintuitive Reality**

As a 10-blind stack with a big bounty, you get called incredibly wide. This makes many intuitively good jamming hands actually unprofitable. Suited aces that dominate calling ranges in freezeouts (A5s, A4s, A3s) lose value because you're not getting folds.

Instead, jam: pairs (which flip against overcards), strong suited broadways (KQs, KJs which flip against pairs and weaker aces), and premium aces (AJs+, ATo+). The key insight: you need hands that perform well when called, not hands with blockers for fold equity.

In a comparison: jamming 20% of hands as a short stack in a PKO versus 28% in a freezeout is common. You must account for wider calling ranges when calculating your jamming range.

When you're short with a large bounty, expect extremely wide calls to your jams. With a 4x starting bounty and 10 blinds, opponents correctly call with hands like Q2s and T7s. This means jam tighter for value (only 55+, A5s+, A9o+, Broadway), include your premium hands (don't slow-play aces), and use a tight limping range for hands too strong to fold but too weak to jam (suited connectors, small pairs).

### Rejamming Against Squeezes

**When You're Covered**

You open from early position with 53 blinds, the button with 87 blinds calls, and the small blind with 11 blinds jams. Despite getting good odds from the bounty, you face a massive problem: the button will overcall wide since they cover you.

Your rejam range must be quite tight: JJ+, AQs+, AKo. Even strong hands like TT or AJs become folds because the button can profitably call with a wide range (pairs, Ax, suited broadways). The risk of losing 53 blinds when the button wakes up with a hand outweighs the bounty incentive.

Suited connectors and small suited aces—normally great for squeeze plays—perform horribly here. You're not getting the short stack to fold, and you're often dominated by the button's calling range.

**When You Cover**

Now reverse the stacks: you have 87 blinds, the button has 53 blinds. In the identical scenario, you can rejam nearly your entire opening range. Even if the button has 50 blinds, you don't care—you cover them and their bounty. The short stack's bounty plus the button's bounty if they call creates massive profit even when called wide.

The stack coverage dynamic is everything in PKO squeezes. Being covered versus covering completely inverts the decision.

### Calling Multiway All-Ins

**The Stack and Bounty Matrix**

A 10-blind stack jams, a 50-blind stack rejams, and you're in the big blind with 40 blinds covering only the short stack. How wide can you call?

First, ignore the short stack's equity almost entirely. Their 10-blind stack plus their bounty makes them nearly irrelevant to your decision. Focus entirely on your equity against the 50-blind rejammer.

Against a standard rejam range (JJ+, AQs+, AKo), you can call quite wide: 99+, AJs+, KQs because even when you lose, you collect the short stack's bounty, dramatically improving your pot odds.

**The Four-Way Scenario**

When multiple players are all-in (small blind rejams, button rejams, and you're calling in the big blind), your calling range actually widens. The shorter additional stack reduces the average equity needed to profit. You can call with 77+, ATs+, KQs—about 20% of hands.

Critical adjustment: low suited aces (A5s-A2s) perform terribly in multiway all-ins. You're almost always dominated. Pocket pairs and suited broadways maintain their equity much better against multiple ranges.

**ICM Considerations in Multiway Spots**

Close to the bubble, your overcalling range tightens dramatically when you don't cover all players involved. In a winner-takes-all simulation, you might call 10% of hands. With actual ICM (54 players left, 24 paid), that shrinks to 6.7%.

The penalty for losing and bubbling overwhelms the bounty incentive. Medium stacks in multiway pots near the bubble must play extremely tight despite getting seemingly good price.

When it goes raise, you call, big blind shoves, raiser calls—you're folding everything except absolute monsters. Pocket Jacks? Fold. Ace-Queen suited? Fold. Ace-King offsuit? Fold. You're only continuing with Queens+, Ace-King suited, and maybe Jacks if the stacks are perfect. The population massively over-calls here, thinking "bounty equity!" But you're not getting bounty equity when you're crushed by two linear ranges.

### Three-Betting Strategy

**Deep Stack Out of Position**

At 70-200 big blinds from the small blind, go smaller (10-11bb instead of 12-14bb). You're accomplishing multiple goals: denying equity from offsuit trash (the button's J9o and Q8o hands have amazing equity realization against your pocket sixes), setting up post-flop decisions, and avoiding reverse implied odds.

You can't shove turn for value with sixes at 200bb deep. But at smaller SPRs, you can check-decide whether to play one, two, or three streets based on texture.

**Medium Stack Playbook**

At 50-80 big blinds, size up to 12-14bb. Now you want that two-street game. You're planning: flop bet 50-75% pot, turn shove. This works beautifully with overpairs and top-pair-good-kicker hands. On J♠6♥3♦ flop, you bet 75% pot with QQ, turn brings 9♠, you shove less than pot. Clean, simple, profitable.

**Range Construction for Bounties**

When you cover the big blind, expand suited hands aggressively. Instead of 3-betting K9o, K5o, Q9o—which flop top pair and create difficult spots—3-bet K6s, Q5s, T8s. These hands make big hands: flushes, straights, two-pairs. You dominate their defending range of suited connectors and can stack them when you connect.

Stop three-betting too linear with offsuit broadway. Don't three-bet K9o, QTo for "value" when covered. These hands make vulnerable top pairs and face constant pressure. Use suited kings and queens instead.

Against short stacks with relevant bounties, expand your three-bet jamming range but contract your three-bet calling range. When they have 15-25 BBs with bounties, jam Ace-Eight offsuit, King-Jack offsuit, small pairs (they fold too much, fearing their bounty), but call with King-Queen suited, Ace-Jack suited (realize equity better, hit stronger ranges). Don't three-bet/call hands like King-Queen offsuit or Ace-Ten offsuit—they perform terribly when your opponent expands their four-bet range due to your bounty.

### Advanced Situational Play

**The Deep Stack Limp-Reraise Trap**

When covered by an aggressive player at 40+ big blinds, employ a counterintuitive strategy: limp premium hands (TT+, AK, AQs) from early/middle position. Aggressive opponents covering your stack operate on simple logic: they want to isolate you, build pots, and pressure your bounty. When stacks are deep, these players stop limping behind balanced ranges and start raising everything—suited aces, offsuit broadways, small pairs, suited connectors.

At 50+ big blinds effective, aggressive opponents dramatically underestimate how often you'll limp-reraise. They associate limp-shoves with 15-20 big blind stacks. But at deeper stacks, this awareness vanishes. They see your limp as weakness and attack relentlessly.

When you limp-reraise to 12+ big blinds, they call absurdly wide: A-J, K-Q, suited tens, pocket sixes, suited connectors—hands they'd never defend against a direct 3-bet. The bounty value clouds their judgment. You create a 30bb pot preflop instead of a 6-7bb three-way pot with weaker SPR and less clarity.

**Small Blind vs Big Blind Covering Dynamics**

At 50+ big blinds, adopt an extremely linear three-betting range. Forget about balancing with suited wheel cards—the button will call your three-bets incredibly wide (even Jack-2 suited, 10-2 suited, 4-2 suited) because they're also hunting the big blind's bounty. Since you're not getting folds, your three-bets become pure value: pocket pairs, Broadway suited hands, premium Aces.

At 30-40 big blinds, shoving becomes more prevalent, but it's still linear. You're jamming suited Aces (A-6 suited through A-9 suited) because when opponents call your wide shoving range, they're calling with Kings, Queens, Jacks—hands your suited Aces flip against while keeping you live to the bounty.

At 25-35 big blinds, shift to almost pure aggression. You're jamming Queen-5 suited, Jack-5 suited, any suited connector. Once you're shoving Queen-5, you can essentially shove any two cards and stay balanced. But you still raise-fold your premium unsuited Aces (Ace-King offsuit through Ace-Jack offsuit) because these hands have too much postflop value to waste as shoves that only get called by better.

**The Ace-King Suited Flat**

When a big stack raises from the cutoff (opening 50%+ because they cover you and the blinds), you call extremely wide on the button—30%+ including Queen-2 suited, 8-5 suited, King-9 offsuit. But when you have Ace-King suited? You flat it. Do not three-bet.

Why? You're inviting the big blind to make a linear squeeze for their tournament life. When they shove Ace-10, Ace-Jack, Ace-Queen, pocket pairs, the original raiser often folds (they have a capped range without premium hands), and you call with Ace-King suited to win two bounties. This is your dream scenario. If you three-bet Ace-King suited preflop, you just fold out all the offsuit Aces you dominate and play a bloated pot out of position with a range that doesn't dominate anyone.

### Final Table Button and Blind Play

**Small Blind Strategic Tiers**

Organize your range into tiers based on action frequency:

**Tier 0 (Premium)**: AA-JJ, AK, AQ—raise 3x, call shoves with appropriate hands. Don't get fancy.

**Tier 1 Suited**: KJs, QJs, JTs, T9s, suited kings down to K6s—raise small. You're not getting shoved on (they'd be calling off against your overpairs), you get flatted by dominated hands, you realize equity beautifully in position.

**Tier 1 Offsuit**: AKo, AQo, KQo—limp heavily. When you raise these, the big blind doesn't fold worse aces or kings. He calls A5s, K8s, QTs—hands with great playability that torment you post-flop. Instead, limp and induce aggressive ISOs. When big blind raises, you can limp-shove and he's forced to fold Q9s, J8s, all his bluffs.

**Tier 2**: Pocket pairs 22-99, suited connectors—limp call or limp-shove. Pairs want to limp-shove against aggressive ISO strategies (big blind is raising 77, A7o, K9s). You're getting it in good and he can't find the fold.

**Tier 3 Suited**: Medium playability hands like T8s, 97s, J9s—limp call only. You want to see flops multiway or heads-up in position.

**The A7o Blocker Play**: A7o makes an excellent limp-shove because it blocks pocket sevens (which big blind raise-calls) while unblocking his raise-fold range of suited sevens and offsuit aces. When he raises, you shove, and he's folding A6s, A8s, K7s, Q7s at high frequency. It's pure exploitation of his aggressive ISO strategy.

**Big Blind vs Small Blind Limps**

When you cover and the small blind limps, ISO aggressively with 43% of hands. Use 3.5x. You're attacking his capped range and forcing him to limp-fold or limp-call with weak holdings. But be aware: good players limp-shove AA-QQ, AKo, AQo at meaningful frequencies to trap your aggression.

When the small blind covers you, tighten dramatically. His limp range is now trappy. Reduce ISO frequency to 25-30%, check back more suited wheel cards and medium pairs (66-88) that hate facing limp-reshoves.

At shallow stacks (25-40 BB), you should be shoving dramatically wider than players realize. In a chip EV sim at 32 BB blind vs blind, you'd shove suited Aces and balance with some weak offsuit Aces. In PKO? You shove Queen-5 suited, Jack-5 suited, 5-4 suited, even 6-3 suited. You're still folding the bottom 15-20% of hands, but you're shoving anything with reasonable equity because the bounty overlay makes it immediately profitable.

You still raise-fold premium unsuited hands (Ace-King offsuit, Ace-Queen offsuit, Ace-Jack offsuit) at 40+ BB. These hands have too much postflop playability to waste as shoves. Build a pot, decrease SPR, and get the money in on favorable boards.

At 12-15 BB late in tournaments, you actually play tighter than chip EV, not looser. In chip EV, you balance limps with traps (limp-calling Queens, Jacks, Ace-Queen suited). In PKO, you never trap because you want to shove wider to put pressure on. Since you're not trapping, you can't expand your limping range to balance it. Result: you shove a tighter range of better hands and simply fold more.

### Post-Flop Adjustments

**Increase Aggression with Draws**

When you flop a flush draw against a covered opponent, bet and raise more aggressively than in regular tournaments. Getting stacks in with 35% equity is often profitable when hunting a bounty. On monotone flops when you have the flush, overbet or jam more frequently.

Combo draws, flush draws, and straight draws should play far more aggressively. Getting it in with 50% equity in a freezeout is marginal. Getting it in with 50% equity in a PKO is hugely profitable because the bounty increases the pot substantially. Bet-bet-jam marginal made hands more often. Check-call less with draws—bet or raise them.

**Polarize Your Betting Ranges**

Use larger sizings more often when covering. On turns and rivers, structure your range around small bets (with medium-strength hands) and jams (with nuts and bluffs). The middle sizing becomes less useful.

On dynamic boards with draws, introduce a sophisticated two-size strategy: large overbet (1.5x pot) with nuts (sets, two-pair, straights) and strong draws (nut flush draws, combo draws), and half-pot bet with medium strength (top pair, overpairs that don't want huge pots) and weaker bluffs without equity. Your opponent must navigate two different ranges with different optimal responses. This complexity creates more mistakes than single-sizing.

**Thin Value Betting Changes**

Against short stacks you cover, value bet thinner on rivers. Hands like top pair weak kicker that would check in regular tournaments can bet 60-70% pot for value. Covered opponents call wider because they're already pot-committed with their bounty in play.

Standard c-betting frequencies shift when bounties dominate. Protection betting increases in value—when you cover opponents, betting hands like top pair becomes more important because you're freerolling the bounty. Getting them to fold and denying equity matters less than building a pot you might stack them in.

Thin value bets expand with large bounties in play. Betting second pair for "value" can be correct if it occasionally gets called by worse and you have the equity to win when you're behind. The bounty compensates for narrow value betting ranges.

**Bluff Less When Covered**

When facing aggression from bigger stacks, resist the urge to bluff. They're attacking your bounty and will call down lighter. Your bluffs need better blockers and clearer stories to succeed.

Against short stacks with 12BB who will be all-in on any turn bet, bluffing flops becomes -EV unless you have significant equity. They're priced in to call with any piece. Focus on betting your value hands and hands with draws.

**Leading and Check-Raising Exploits**

When chip leaders open extremely wide (Queen-Nine offsuit, King-Ten offsuit territory), exploit with small leads on dry boards. On A-7-4 rainbow or similar, lead 30-40% with hands that don't block folds, targeting immediate folds from King-Nine offsuit, Queen-Ten offsuit. They open so wide that they connect weakly. They expect you to check-raise strong hands, so leads get more respect. The bounty dynamic makes them less likely to hero-play against you.

Against aggressive regulars on dry boards, consider small check-raises more frequently. With hands like Ace-Three on A-8-6 rainbow, always check-raise (not check-call) because river play becomes impossible when they barrel, they barrel too many weak hands, and you need to define your range early. With hands like Ace-Eight, check-call—you dominate their King-Eight/Jack-Eight type hands and can value bet turns.

### Bubble and Final Table Dynamics

**Bubble Factor Reality**

Yes, final tables have the highest bubble factor of any tournament stage. But here's what matters: if everyone plays tight for 90 minutes while short stacks blind down, being chip leader is worth 3-4 extra buy-ins compared to being middle stack. The "correct" play is often to loosen up before the final table to accumulate chips.

Nine-handed final tables regularly take 60-90 minutes before the first elimination. Short stacks survive because big stacks play scared. Don't be that player.

Most players tighten excessively on final table bubbles. This creates exploitable situations. Attack from late position relentlessly when short stacks are clinging to ladders. Even hands like Q7o become profitable opens when everyone's playing scared.

The difference between 9th and 8th might be \$400, but first place is \$16,000+. If you've got 20+BB, don't risk your stack in marginal spots just to survive one more elimination. Play for the win, not the min-cash bump.

**Big Stack Exploitation Window**

When you're covering everyone at a final table, you can raise 60% from the cutoff while covered players raise 18%. This 3x frequency advantage compounds massively. Every orbit you're collecting blinds profitably while they're folding premiums.

The real edge isn't just raising wider—it's that they have to play tighter everywhere. Your button vs. their big blind? They're folding A2o, QTs, 87s. In chip EV they'd defend these happily. But ICM pressure plus bounty risk makes them fold, fold, fold.

When you become chip leader with multiple short stacks at your table, shift to a patient exploitation model. You're not trying to accumulate slowly—you're positioning yourself to maximize bounty opportunities while protecting your lead. Open tight (around 20% of hands) against covered opponents, use small raises (2x) to preserve fold equity, let shorter stacks battle each other—collision effects do your work—and attack aggressively when heads-up with the big blind.

**Information Gathering Matters Short-Handed**

With 30+ big blinds at a final table against weaker opponents, playing conservatively early allows you to collect crucial reads. You'll see how recreationals respond to aggression, which spots they over-fold, and where they can't help but call off light. This information becomes ammunition for later spots.

**Collision Course Mathematics**

When two similar-sized stacks fight while you're out of the hand, your ICM equity increases regardless of who wins. Correctly identify spots to open-fold marginal hands when two players behind are in ICM death matches, your bounty isn't worth enough to gamble, and letting them collide increases your tournament equity more than playing.

Track relative stack sizes obsessively. When players within 5BB of each other are behind you, fold hands you'd normally open. Let them destroy each other.

## Practical Examples

**Example 1: Big Blind Defense When Covering**

\$109 PKO, 5K starting stacks, blinds 50/100 with 12.5 ante. You're in the big blind with 5K. Hijack with 5K and a starting bounty (\$50) opens to 250.

In a freezeout, you need 48.2% equity to call off. The bounty is worth 1,250 chips (25% of a starting stack), which adjusts required equity to 42.9%—a 5.3% reduction.

From HRC analysis against a reasonable hijack opening range (40%), you can profitably jam: any pair, A9s+, A5s+, KTs+, QTs+, AJo+, KQo. This is dramatically wider than a freezeout defense.

**Example 2: Jamming from the Button Near the Bubble**

\$530 PKO, you're on the button with 125 blinds. Small blind has 20 blinds with 3x starting bounty, big blind has 34 blinds with 5x starting bounty. You're 15 players from the money.

The small blind's 3x bounty is worth roughly 15 blinds. Combined with ICM pressure on them, you can

# Chapter 3: ICM and Final Table Domination

## Overview

Final table play separates good tournament players from great ones. When you reach the final nine players, the game fundamentally transforms—chip value becomes non-linear, survival equity matters more than accumulation, and every decision carries amplified consequences worth thousands of dollars in pay jump differences. This chapter reveals how elite players weaponize ICM pressure, exploit stack dynamics, and adapt their entire strategic framework to dominate when it matters most.

## Core Principles

### ICM Changes Everything About Chip Value

In normal poker, chips have linear value—doubling your stack doubles your tournament equity. But at final tables, this relationship breaks down completely. When you risk chips, you're not just risking tournament life; you're risking pay jumps that can represent multiple buy-ins.

This creates three fundamental pressures:

**The Big Stack Advantage**: When you're the chip leader, you can exploit ICM pressure on everyone else. Your opponents can't call as wide because losing chips costs them more than it costs you. This means you can open 70%+ from the button against tight regulars who understand they're in an ICM prison. When big stacks battle each other, however, they become extremely polarized—the chip leader three-betting another big stack can't risk his tournament life with middling hands like pocket tens or Ace-Queen.

**The Medium Stack Dilemma**: You're caught between short stacks desperate to ladder and big stacks applying pressure. Your goal isn't to accumulate chips—it's to survive into better spots while avoiding catastrophic confrontations with other big stacks. With 27-40 big blinds, your primary job is: *don't die*. This means no limping suited connectors in early position, no defending wide against chip leader aggression, and avoiding marginal opens when bad lineups surround you.

**The Short Stack Reality**: Contrary to popular belief, you often need to play *looser* as a short stack when pay jumps are small. If going from 11th to 9th only nets half a buy-in, you can't afford to blind down. Your opponents expect tight play, so controlled aggression becomes profitable. At 8-10 big blinds with antes, you should be looking for any marginally +EV spot to accumulate rather than folding into oblivion.

### The Collision Effect: Your Secret Weapon

When you have multiple short stacks at the table, they create "collision effect"—the chance they'll eliminate each other while you ladder up for free. This changes everything:

- Against one short stack, you might defend your big blind normally
- Against three short stacks, you can fold Ace-Queen offsuit profitably
- The more chaos behind you, the tighter you can play

When you fold on the button with a short stack in the blinds, the small blind will jam very wide (50%+ of hands), but the big blind with a deep stack has to call quite tight because of ICM considerations. This "free" equity you gain by folding often exceeds the small edge you'd get from marginal opens.

Think of it this way: if you fold and two opponents put their tournament lives at risk against each other, someone busts—and you climb the pay ladder without risking a single chip. When a 30-big-blind player battles another 30-big-blind player and one busts 16% of the time, you're essentially banking thousands of dollars every time you fold into that scenario.

### Blockers Become Critical

At final tables, blockers shift from nice-to-have to essential. When you're bluffing, blocking your opponent's calling range (particularly Jacks and Sevens on boards like J74) matters enormously. When you're bluff-catching, blocking their value range becomes the difference between a call and a fold.

On river bluffs, your holding matters more than your story. Bluff with hands that:
- Unblock calling ranges (don't hold the ace when trying to rep aces)
- Block potential bluff-catchers in your opponent's range
- Have the absolute bottom of your range with no showdown value

When considering a river call with a bluff-catcher, always ask: "What bluffs make sense in my opponent's range, and do I block them?" If you block bluffs and unblock value, fold. If you block value and unblock bluffs, call.

## Key Strategies

### Pre-Final Table Preparation

The difference between winning \$100,000 and \$150,000 often comes down to preparation, not cards. Here's the system elite players use:

**Step 1: Document Stack Distributions**

Write down every stack size and calculate big blind equivalents. Are pay jumps meaningful? If 11th through 8th all pay similarly, expect aggressive play immediately. If there's a massive jump at 6th place, expect the table to tighten dramatically as you approach it.

Ask yourself: "Will this be a fast start or slow start?" This dictates whether you should play tight initially or press your edges immediately.

**Step 2: Map Player Dynamics**

For each opponent you're likely to play against, document:
- **What they think about you**: If they've seen you make a specific play, they'll remember
- **Their ICM awareness**: Do they understand when to fold? Players like Michael Addamo open 10-3 suited under the gun because they know opponents overfold in ICM spots
- **Recent history**: If they just lost a big pot, momentum shifts matter

**Step 3: Run ICM Simulations**

Use ICM calculators to simulate specific situations you expect. If a player opens 70% from the button, input various stack sizes and see your shoving ranges. Test different stack depths so you're prepared whether you're the 2nd shortest or 4th shortest stack.

### Stack-Specific Adjustments

**Playing as Big Stack**

Your edge comes from relentless pressure, but not reckless aggression. The key insight: you can often play closer to Chip EV than your opponents because losing a stack doesn't cripple you.

Open aggressively (60-75% from the button) against tight regulars who understand ICM. They know they can't defend without premium hands. When they do fight back in large pots, don't assume they're bluffing—they're signaling real strength because they understand the risks.

Against other big stacks, exercise caution. Big stack versus big stack confrontations are ICM disasters. Check back more on flops, use smaller bet sizes, and avoid turning hands into massive bluffs unless you have specific reads.

With 100+ big blinds facing a medium stack (30-50bb) open from early position, you can flat hands as wide as 64s, 75s, and 85s. Why? Your opponent has massive risk premium postflop—they can't use large bet sizes without risking elimination, they can't check-raise or apply normal pressure, and every marginal hand you hold over-realizes its equity.

**Playing as Medium Stack**

Your nightmare scenario: confrontations with other medium stacks or big stacks. Losing a pot doesn't just cost chips—it drops you into short-stack territory where you're desperate.

The solution is patience and spot selection:
- Defend your big blind wider against short stacks (they're shoving wide out of desperation)
- Fold marginal hands against big stacks, even hands like King-Queen offsuit
- Attack the short stacks yourself with aggressive isolation raises

When you do open, use smaller sizes (2-2.2x) to maintain fold equity without committing too much. If you face a 3-bet, you can fold without catastrophic damage.

With hands like pocket threes in the hijack with 27 big blinds, this becomes a fold when a big blind whale and aggressive players are behind. You can't profitably continue against pressure, and you're creating exactly the scenario ICM hates.

**Playing as Short Stack**

The biggest leak players have is folding too much. When you're 6-10 big blinds and pay jumps are small, shift toward Chip EV thinking. Your goal is accumulating a stack that can threaten for the win, not laddering one spot for an extra \$5,000.

This means:
- Opening wider than opponents expect (any suited ace, any pocket pair, connected cards)
- Shoving over opens with hands like Ace-7 offsuit when the opener's range is wide
- Avoiding the trap of waiting for Ace-King—you'll blind out and get called light when you finally shove

With 15 big blinds, you face constant decisions between open-shoving, min-raising, and limping. Your **limp-only ranges** should include weak suited aces that can limp-call or limp-fold, suited connectors that play poorly all-in but well multi-way, and pocket pairs below eights that want cheap set-mining. Your **min-raise ranges** should include strong aces (AJ+), pocket pairs tens-plus, and suited broadway. Your **open-shove ranges** should include weak hands with good blockers, hands that can't stand a three-bet, and any hand when the button opens and you're in the blinds with 8-12 big blinds.

### Exploiting Wide Opens and Tight Ranges

**When Facing a 60%+ Opener**

When facing a player opening 100% from the button, don't just call wider—charge a premium. Increase your raise sizing to 2.5x or even 3x. The worst response is to engage in marginal spots with speculative hands that play poorly postflop against relentless aggression.

For pocket nines facing a wide open with a potential flat behind: this is a fold or flat, never a jam. Even against a wide opening range, if the flatting range behind is condensed to tens through aces at any frequency, your jam becomes -EV.

Expand your **flatting range aggressively**: suited broadways, suited connectors, medium pairs, even suited kings become calls. In ICM environments, opponents struggle to apply proper pressure postflop—they bet too small, check too much on turns, and rarely find correct river jams.

**Against Tight Opens**

When the under-the-gun player opens with 20 big blinds, they're not opening 9-8 suited or Queen-Eight offsuit. They're opening premium hands and high broadways. This tight range has a cascading effect: their after-flop realization becomes extremely high because they can aggressively continuation-bet knowing you can't defend with marginal holdings.

Against these tight ranges, your defending range must contract dramatically. Fold hands like King-Nine offsuit from the big blind. The collision isn't just about immediate all-ins—it's about the pressure mounting with each decision.

### The 20bb Inflection Point

At 20 big blinds against a 62% opener, **your jamming range explodes**: all suited broadways, suited aces, 22+, most suited kings, hands like QJo, KTo become profitable jams. This is the sweet spot where you have enough fold equity to make marginal hands profitable but aren't risking so much that ICM constrains you.

However, here's the critical insight most players miss: **when you're 20bb deep and want a raise-call range, you often cannot have a profitable shoving range.** If you shove 20bb with hands like ATs, KQs, 77 while keeping QQ+, AK in your raise-call range, your opponents can call profitably with 77+, AT+, A7s+ because you've capped your shoving range.

The solution: Construct three distinct ranges:
- **Raise-call range (inducing):** QQ+, AK, AQs+ (hands that want action)
- **Raise-fold range (standard):** All other playable hands—you're applying pressure without the 20bb risk
- **Shoving range:** Nothing, or extremely narrow (JJ or suited aces if you must)

At 20bb, you have playability. You can defend blinds later, you can resteal. By raising small (2bb), you risk 2bb to win 1.7bb instead of risking 20bb.

### Three-Betting Dynamics

**The Small-Size Revolution**

The 4-4.5x non-all-in three-bet dominates final table dynamics. This play forces opponents to fold 60-70% of their range (suited kings, ace-x offsuit, all suited connectors, weak pocket pairs). When to use it: You're in position with 15-25 BBs against a late position open.

What to three-bet: Your value (aces, kings, ace-king) AND premium bluffs (ace-seven suited, king-jack offsuit). Why opponents hate it: They're getting bad implied odds to flat call with speculative hands. Shoving over the top requires a premium hand. Folding feels weak but is correct 70% of the time.

**Hand Selection for Three-Bet Bluffs:**
- Ace-seven suited > Ace-ten offsuit (blocks ace-x reshoves, has suited equity)
- King-queen offsuit > Queen-jack suited (better against calling ranges)
- Avoid small pairs—they block nothing and play poorly when called

The common mistake: Three-betting too large. When you make it 6-7x, you force yourself all-in and kill your fold equity against better hands. The small size lets you fold to four-bets while still applying maximum pressure.

**Against Big Stack Aggression**

When the chip leader sits on your immediate left, getting aggressive becomes dangerous. If you open and they reshove, you're in a disaster spot. Tighten your opening range but maintain aggression with premium hands. Don't open ace-five offsuit into a chip leader who can three-bet shove profitably.

With pocket tens from middle position when a 70bb chip leader is behind, many players either three-bet or shove. Better play: flat call. Three-betting induces shoves from jacks+, ace-king (you're flipping or crushed). Flatting keeps their bluffs in range and allows you to play post-flop in position with a strong but vulnerable hand.

### Post-Flop Strategy Under ICM

**Board Texture Dictates Everything**

Stop defaulting to the same bet size regardless of board texture. On King-high boards where you hold ace-high, you don't need massive overbets—smaller bets allow you to barrel multiple streets without letting draws get there cheaply.

On a K♦9♦3♦ flop after opening, bet 66% pot with your entire range. Your opponent must fold king-queen without a diamond, any pocket pair under kings, and all ace-high. They can't afford to float with equity and risk a turn shove.

On monotone boards with a middling pair, you're actually in better shape than it appears. Your opponent's flatting range preflop rarely contains the nut flush because premium spades three-bet. Range bet these textures—your opponent has few strong hands and will check back ace-high, king-high, even pairs frequently.

**Turn and River Play**

The turn is where you define your story. If you bet small on the flop, you can't suddenly overbet turn unless the card changes everything. Your sizing should build logically across streets.

When an ace hits the turn after you've been aggressive, that's often a perfect card to barrel again—even with air. Your opponent will give you credit for ace-x in your range, and their medium-strength hands suddenly look much weaker.

By the river, ICM pressure compounds. Players become increasingly unable to call down with bluff-catchers. Exploit pattern: Bet flop with a merged range, check-back turn with medium-strength hands (second pair, weak top pair), then bet river as a pure bluff when missed draws brick. By the river, opponents have invested chips on the flop and turn. Their stack-to-pot ratio is now distorted—calling off 30-40BB with ace-high or weak pairs is ICM suicide.

**Value Betting When ICM Makes Them Passive**

"ICM pressure makes them passive" doesn't mean you should be passive. When you open Ace-Three offsuit from a 50-big-blind stack with short stacks of 18, 14, and 17 behind you, and the board comes Ace-King-Queen rainbow, bet the flop, bet the turn, and bet the river for value.

Your range is incredibly strong here—suited aces, pocket pairs, and high broadways. Your opponent in the big blind isn't check-raising a single hand. Even Jack-Ten will call down slowly. You're targeting Queens, Kings, any club draw, weak aces, and protecting against pocket fives through nines.

**Leading vs Checking After Defending Big Blind**

You defend 55 vs a button open and see 532 rainbow. Should you lead or check? The solver checks this board at extremely high frequency, but most players lead reflexively with their made hands.

When you check, the button will c-bet with AK, KQ, and various king-high hands. These hands will check back turns when you check-raise or check-call, denying themselves equity they would have realized had you folded preflop. When you lead, you force them into a binary decision where they fold immediately or continue, and you gain nothing from the times they would have bluffed air at you.

Lead instead on boards like 765 rainbow where you actually have the connected hands (65s, 75s) and they have more high-card air.

### Bet Sizing Exploitation

ICM creates uncomfortable spots where players choose sizes that don't align with their ranges. Exploit this:

**Oversized raises from 12bb stacks**: When someone raises (not shoves) to 3x from 12bb, their range becomes extremely polarized. They're raising Queens/Kings/Aces but shoving Jacks and Ace-King. This creates huge gaps—reshove Ace-X offsuit profitably because they fold 70%+ of the time and you have equity when called.

**Small continuation bets**: When boards are dynamic (King-Queen-4 with two hearts), many players bet 20-25% pot trying to "control the pot." But their range is capped—strong hands would bet larger for protection. Attack these spots with polarized check-raises, especially when you have backdoor equity.

**Custom bet sizes leak information**: When you manually type unusual amounts, you're telling observant opponents "this is special." Use preset buttons for your entire range. When you hear "scrolling going up on the mouse" during a bet—someone manually typing in an unusual amount like 42% pot instead of using preset buttons—this "often means quite strong."

### Field Size and Bubble Adjustments

**Small fields (100-250 runners):** Against any-two shoves, you can defend with approximately A7s+, A9o+, KQo, 66+. This is your baseline—roughly 12-15% of hands when facing pure aggression.

**Medium fields (500-1,000 runners):** Tighten to A8s+, AJo+, 77+. You're now calling about 8-10% of hands. The increased number of tables means more mistakes happening elsewhere that you benefit from without risking chips.

**Large fields (2,000+ runners):** Go ultra-tight: 99+, AQs+, AKo. Target approximately 5-6% of hands. With 1,000+ tables running, someone is punting on another table right now. You don't need this spot.

**Distance from the money creates dramatic swings.** At 20% from the money (18 players left when 15 get paid), you call 82s happily. On the pure bubble with identical stacks? That same situation makes similar EV with better hands. The 20% threshold is where ICM pressure releases significantly.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: The Disciplined Fold with Premium Cards

You hold King-Jack offsuit in the small blind with 25 big blinds. Under-the-gun (30 big blinds) opens. You know both you and UTG are aggressive, and there's a 6-big-blind stack two seats away.

Ace-King is strong, but if you three-bet and create warfare, you prevent the short stack from busting naturally. The big blind (27 big blinds) might also get involved. Multiple collision opportunities disappear if you get aggressive.

**Exploitative play:** Flat call occasionally, or even fold if ICM pressure is extreme and the short stack is extremely short. Let the table play itself. This isn't weakness; it's recognizing that folding and letting two short stacks clash creates more value than winning this pot.

### Example 2: Exploiting Wide Opens with Reshoves

**Situation**: 12bb effective, villain opens to 3x from cutoff (58% range), you're in the big blind with Ace-Seven offsuit.

**Why Standard Defense Fails**: Calling seems standard, but in ICM, you're often dominated (villain has King-Queen, Ace-King, etc.) and face difficult flop decisions.

**The Adjustment**: Reshove. Villain's calling range is polarized to Queens+/Ace-King (maybe Jacks), approximately 2-3% of hands. You're folding out their entire raising range of suited connectors, weak aces, and Broadway hands—plus you have equity when called.

### Example 3: Turn Leads with Range Advantage

**Situation**: You defend big blind with 4-3 suited, flop Queen-3-2 rainbow. Villain checks back. Turn: 6 of your flush draw suit.

**Why This Spot is Golden**: Villain's checking range is capped—no sets (would bet), no two-pair (would bet), no aces with your suit (would bet). Their range is pure bluff-catchers: Ace-Queen, King-Queen, pocket pairs.

**The Play**: Lead turn for 50-66% pot. You're representing flushes, sets, and two-pairs that all logically check-called flop. If called, your hand has equity (flush draw, straight draws, pair outs). If raised, you can fold—they don't raise weak here.

### Example 4: River Bluffs Without Blockers

**Situation**: Three-way pot, you're in big blind with Ten-Nine offsuit. Board runs out Ace-King-4-6-6 with a club flush completing. Both opponents check turn and river.

**Standard Thinking**: "I should have a club to bluff" or "I block their folding range with my tens and nines."

**ICM Thinking**: Both opponents checked twice—neither has flushes, sets, or strong kings. Your blockers don't matter because their entire ranges are capped. They're holding Ace-X and small pairs, waiting for showdown.

**The Play**: Bet 50-66% pot representing the flush nobody has. Your specific blockers are irrelevant when both ranges are this weak.

### Example 5: The Pocket Nines Disaster

MP opens from 40 big blinds. You have pocket nines on the button with 16 big blinds. Your instinct says shove—but let's calculate: When you reshove, you fold out ace-jack suited (which you flip against), ace-ten suited (which you beat), king-queen suited (which you beat). You get snap-called by jacks-plus and ace-king, all of which have you crushed or flipping.

The sim shows pocket nines loses \$12,600 by reshoving here. Even if the opener widens their range significantly, nines still loses \$4,000. The mistake compounds because you block your opponent's folding range—queen-jack and king-queen contain your nines blocker. Instead, use hands like ace-five suited that have equity against overpairs and block calling ranges effectively.

### Example 6: The Collision Effect Fold

You're in the hijack with king-jack offsuit with 19BB. Behind you are stacks of 16BB, 13BB, and 15BB. The collision effect is massive here. Multiple players behind you are incentivized to shove because they know you'll likely fold. Your hand has poor equity when called, and you're not getting enough folds to make up for the times you run into a hand.

When you fold, the cutoff shoves 75% of hands. The button and big blind clash approximately 20% of the time when this happens, creating a 10-15% total elimination rate. At a \$30,000 pay jump, that's \$3,000-\$4,500 in expected value from folding. Your king-jack open, even if profitable in isolation, can't overcome this massive collision value.

### Example 7: The Seven-Big-Blind Decision

You have seven big blinds on the button with an ultra-short stack (2 big blinds) in the blinds. Queen-ten offsuit looks marginal, and it is—earning only \$412 by shoving versus folding. But the solver shows you should shove 35% here, a tight range because both blinds must call wider to prevent exploitation.

Against these adjusted calling ranges (small blind calling king-jack offsuit, big blind calling pocket sevens), queen-ten barely scrapes into the shoving range. One pip lower—queen-nine offsuit—and you're burning money.

### Example 8: The Limp-Reraise Trap

With A2o at 28 big blinds in the small blind, don't limp-shove. Instead, limp and reraise to 8 big blinds when the big blind isolates.

Why? The big blind isolates with a polar range—strong value and wide bluffs. When he raises to 3.5x, he's trying to make you limp-fold, but he's also including hands like T7o and 95s. Your limp-reraise folds out his junk while still allowing you to play post-flop when called. You're never folding out his value anyway, so target the weak isolation attempts.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Over-defending from the big blind**: Just because you're getting 3:1 doesn't mean you call in ICM. Against raises from short stacks, defend normally. Against raises from big stacks covering you, fold hands like King-Ten offsuit that create difficult post-flop decisions.

**Studying ICM with preflop solvers**: Solvers output unexploitable strategies for infinite samples. But final tables are one-time events with specific player dynamics. Study by simulating specific situations and thinking logically, not memorizing charts.

**Playing passively as chip leader**: The biggest edge in ICM comes from applying pressure as the big stack. If you're opening 40% from the button when you could open 70%, you're leaving massive EV on the table.

**Limping short-stacked**: When you're 10-15bb with antes, limping creates scenarios where you fold to isos with hands that should shove. Either open (with a plan to call shoves) or fold. Limp-folding King-Eight offsuit is a disaster.

**Ignoring future game dynamics**: If two big stacks are battling constantly, your equity for 2nd and 3rd place increases (they'll likely eliminate each other) but your win equity decreases (the survivor will have a massive stack against you). Adjust your risk tolerance accordingly.

**Playing the same way at different stack depths**: The difference between 20bb and 15bb feels small but is massive mathematically. Your jamming ranges should be radically different. At 30bb, even against a maniac opening 62% who folds 90% to your shove, you remain surprisingly tight with pocket sixes. Drop to 20bb with identical dynamics, and your jamming range explodes.

**Reshoving Underpairs Without Fold Equity**: Pocket sixes through pocket tens have terrible reshove properties when you don't fold out better. You never fold pocket jacks, you never fold ace-king, and you only fold out the ace-x and suited connectors you're flipping against anyway. Use these hands to flat-call or fold, depending on stack depths.

**Overvaluing Chip EV at Flat Payout Structures**: Even "flat" final table payouts create substantial ICM pressure. The difference between fifth and fourth might be "only" five big blinds, but when everyone has 8-15 big blinds, that's 30-40% of your stack in pure pay jump value.

## Implementation Checklist

**Before each final table:**
- [ ] Write down all stack sizes and pay jumps—identify where ICM pressure is highest
- [ ] Determine if this will be fast-paced (small pay jumps) or slow (large pay jump ahead)
- [ ] For each big/medium stack, note one specific dynamic or tell you've observed
- [ ] Run 3-5 ICM simulations for situations you expect (button vs. blind, reshove spots)
- [ ] Calculate pay jumps before every session: Know the dollar value of each elimination
- [ ] Identify the "fighting zone": Mark which stacks are likely to clash

**During Play:**
- [ ] Before each decision, ask: "What are the stack sizes behind me?"
- [ ] Before each hand, identify the effective stack (usually the 2nd or 3rd shortest player)
- [ ] Count short stacks—if two players have under 10 big blinds, tighten significantly
- [ ] Against raises from awkward stacks (10-15bb), look for reshove spots with Ace-X
- [ ] When checking back as preflop aggressor, note your opponent is capped—prepare to attack turn/river
- [ ] On scary board runouts, focus on range reading over your specific hand
- [ ] Use smaller sizes (2x opens, 20-33% pot c-bets) to maintain flexibility
- [ ] When you're short but not desperate (10-15bb), resist action until 2+ opponents collide
- [ ] On checked-through flops, bet the turn more frequently for protection
- [ ] Before river bluffing, ask: "What blockers do I have and what do I want them to fold?"
- [ ] Before bluff-catching, ask: "Do I block their value or their bluffs?"

**Stack-Specific:**
- [ ] Cut opening ranges 30-40% when short stacks sit directly behind you
- [ ] Widen your opening range against tight players by 20-30%
- [ ] Tighten your calling range when covered by aggressive big stacks
- [ ] From the blinds with 15-30 big blinds, incorporate limping with strong and medium hands
- [ ] Against tight opens, expand your three-bet range, especially from late position
- [ ] On draw-heavy boards that brick, increase turn aggression frequency
- [ ] With short stack on your left, widen your opening range to abuse their paralysis
- [ ] With 15 big blinds effective, adopt three-bet or fold from the small blind, never flat
- [ ] When you flop the nuts, calculate SPR—if under 2, just get it in; if over 3, build the pot

**Bet Sizing:**
- [ ] Before any shove with 8-12bb, quickly check if your hand is truly +EV
- [ ] Use 60-75% pot bets as your standard sizing
- [ ] Use 30-40% on draw-heavy boards where you want multiple streets
- [ ] Use 125%+ when you're polarized and credible
- [ ] Check your blockers before bluffing—am I blocking their folds or their calls?
- [ ] With strong showdown value on draw-heavy boards, default to check-calling rivers

The final table isn't about playing poker perfectly—it's about weaponizing tournament dynamics to accumulate chips when others are paralyzed by fear. Master these adjustments, and you'll consistently outperform opponents with better card sense but weaker strategic adaptation. ICM and collision effects create exploitable situations in every hand—the players who recognize and capitalize on these moments don't just reach final tables, they dominate them.

# Chapter 4: Preflop Adaptations

## Overview

The single biggest mistake tournament players make is treating preflop strategy like cash game poker. They memorize hand charts for uniform 20bb or 30bb scenarios, then freeze when facing real tournament conditions: a 30bb stack with opponents at 15bb, 50bb, and 25bb all acting behind them. This chapter teaches you to think dynamically—exploiting population tendencies, adjusting to mixed stack sizes, and engineering maximum value with your premium hands at every depth. Forget static charts. Real tournament poker demands adaptation.

## Core Principles

**The Reality of Tournament Stack Dynamics**

Tournament poker is messy. From 5bb to 60bb, stacks are constantly mixed at your table. Yet most training focuses on uniform scenarios—30bb versus 30bb versus 30bb—that simply don't exist in real play. This creates two fatal problems: players can't adapt when effective stacks differ, and they miss crucial exploits because population tendencies deviate massively from theoretical ranges.

The truth is that three stack sizes matter simultaneously in almost every hand: your effective stack with the opener, your effective stack with other players yet to act, and the stacks of players behind you. Each creates different pressure points. At 32bb, opponents call reshoves relatively wide—they're pot-committed enough to gamble. At 45bb+, calling ranges contract dramatically as players risk half their tournament life. Understanding this dynamic is worth more than memorizing a hundred static ranges.

**Why Top-of-Range Play Matters Most**

The biggest EV swings come from how you play premium hands—aces through tens. Play these 2% better across all stack depths and you'll see more profit than memorizing whether to open K5s at 27bb. Your job is engineering situations where your best hands extract maximum value. At 100bb, this means limp-raising to create manageable stack-to-pot ratios. At 25bb, it means fast-playing aggressively. At 10bb, it means shoving for maximum fold equity.

**The Stack Depth Philosophy**

At shallow depths (25bb and under), winning the blinds and antes represents a significant chip increase—you're adding 15-20% to your stack. Aggressive, pot-building plays make sense. At deep depths (100bb+), winning 1.5bb means almost nothing—you're adding 1.5% to your stack. Small ball, defensive play, and trap-setting become optimal. You need to see flops, not end hands preflop.

This philosophical shift should guide every decision. When shallow, ask: "How do I maximize fold equity?" When deep, ask: "How do I see flops with controlled pot sizes?"

**The Theory-Reality Gap**

At every stack depth, population tendencies deviate dramatically from theory. Players 3-bet 50-60% less frequently than solvers suggest from the blinds. They over-shove versus limps at 20bb. They under-isolate limpers at 100bb. They call too tight versus large 3-bets from 30bb stacks. Each deviation creates exploitable opportunities worth multiple big blinds per hour if you adjust correctly.

## Key Strategies

### Deep Stack Blind vs Blind: The Limp-Raise Trap (100bb+)

**The Problem with Fast-Playing Deep**

When you're 100bb deep in the small blind and raise aces to 3bb, even if called, the pot is 6bb with 94bb behind—a stack-to-pot ratio of 15:1. You're going to struggle getting stacks in as a favorite. The money doesn't flow naturally into the middle. You'll either win a small pot preflop or face agonizing decisions on unfavorable boards.

**The Solution: Limp Your Premium Hands**

At 100bb, limp over 90-95% of hands from the small blind, including your entire premium range—tens through aces. Why? You're setting a trap for isolation raises. When you limp, your opponent isolates with hands like KJo, QTo, KTo, A9o, suited aces, and suited connectors—reasonable hands they can't fold to your limp. When they raise to 4bb and you limp-reraise to 16bb, suddenly the pot is 32bb with 84bb behind—an SPR of 2.6. Now you're positioned to stack off profitably.

Your limp-raise value range should be:
- Pocket pairs: TT-AA (mixing some medium pairs for board coverage)
- Broadway hands: AQs+, AKo, sometimes AJs

Don't get creative. These are your trapping hands. Your bluffs when you limp-call then face aggression are hands like A3o-A5o and K5o—hands that fold out better ace-x and have equity when called.

**Population Exploit**

Most players don't limp-raise enough at 100bb, and they over-isolate you with hands like KJo, QJs, AT. This makes your strategy even more profitable—you're getting raised by exactly the hands you want to play big pots against. Track opponent isolation frequencies: if they're isolating 50%+, your limp-raise range prints money. If they're isolating under 35%, expand your direct raising range with marginal hands instead.

**The Dream Scenario**

You limp KK. Big blind raises to 3.5bb. You reraise to 14bb. They call with K9s. The flop comes K♠9♣5♦. The pot is 28bb with 86bb behind—an SPR of 3:1. You bet 15bb, they raise to 40bb, you shove 86bb, and they're never folding. Compare this to raising preflop: you'd have a 6bb pot with 97bb behind, making it vastly harder to get stacks in except on perfect boards.

### Deep Stack Button vs Blinds (100bb+)

**Button's Opening Strategy**

At 100bb effective, the button opens wide—about 55% of hands—using mostly a 2.5x sizing. Hands like J2s, T3s, and 54s are all reasonable opens. Mix in some larger sizes (3x) rarely for deception, but don't overcomplicate this—just use 2.5x for your entire range.

**Small Blind Defense: Call More Than You Think**

The small blind should defend about 14% by calling and 15% total by 3-betting. Here's what surprises most players about the calling range:

You're calling hands like:
- J7s, Q6s, K3s, K2s (suited kings down to deuces!)
- 54s, 65s, 76s
- A8o, A9o, weak offsuit aces

These aren't "bottom of range 3-bets"—that's outdated thinking. You want to 3-bet high-equity hands that can get stacks in (like AJs, KQs, QJs, JTs), not marginal suited junk. The suited junk plays better as calls because it has postflop playability but struggles when opponents 4-bet.

**Big Blind Squeeze Strategy**

After button opens and small blind calls, the big blind should squeeze frequently (about 13-14%) to exploit the capped small blind range. Use a smaller squeeze size—around 5-6x—because you're leveraging the squeeze dynamic, not trying to build a huge pot.

Your squeezing range focuses on:
- Middle suited connectors (76s, 87s, 98s)
- Suited broadways (JTs+)
- Some suited aces (with A6o specifically for board coverage and to unblock folding hands)

This range gives you excellent board coverage and makes the small blind's capped calling range extremely uncomfortable. The small blind flatted instead of 3-betting, so they're capped at hands like QJo, KTo, small pairs, and suited connectors. When you squeeze, the button folds frequently (they opened wide), and the small blind folds most of their range. When called, you have position on the small blind and solid equity even when behind.

**Why Big Blind Uses Smaller Sizes**

When squeezing after a call, use 5-6x instead of the 15x you'd use against just an open. The small blind's range is already cut and weakened—you can get folds cheaper. When you do get called, your suited connectors still have 30%+ equity even against better hands.

### Mixed Stack Sizes: The Most Important Skill

**The Core Problem**

Standard charts show you 20bb ranges when everyone has 20bb. But what happens when you have 50bb in the hijack facing a 12bb cutoff, 18bb button, 20bb small blind, and 12bb big blind? Your strategy must account for all stack depths simultaneously, not just your own stack size.

**Playing Against Short Stack Opens**

When a 12bb cutoff opens and you have 50bb on the button:

1. **You cannot call**. With deep stacks behind, calling creates a squeeze opportunity for them and allows short stacks to realize equity cheaply. You must play 3-bet or fold.

2. **3-bet smaller than normal** (around 3x instead of 4x+). You're exploiting the fact that the short stack has a polarized range. A smaller 3-bet size generates folds from their weak holdings while committing you against their jamming range.

3. **Your 3-betting range is polar**: Strong hands (QQ+, AK) for value, plus suited wheel aces and suited connectors as bluffs. You're forcing the short stack and the blinds to make difficult decisions.

**The Counterintuitive Reality: More Fold Equity When Deep**

Here's what shocks players: when you jam 25bb over a short stack's open and you have deep stacks behind, you often get *more* fold equity, not less. Why? Players behind must risk their entire 40bb or 50bb stack against multiple ranges. This dramatically tightens their continuing requirements. You can expand your squeezing range because the big blind with 40bb can't just jam pocket sixes—they're risking 40bb, not 20bb.

**When You're the Short Stack Opening**

If you have 12bb in the cutoff with deeper stacks behind (button has 50bb, blinds have 30bb and 12bb), your strategy shifts dramatically:

- **Min-raise more, shove less**: Your min-raise creates a tough spot for the button (they can't call, must 3-bet or fold) and you can fold to aggression
- **Min-raise range**: All your suited kings, suited aces, some suited connectors, and pocket pairs 77+
- **Don't min-raise too weak**: Population over-shoves against min-raises, so hands like K5s, Q7s that would be min-raises in theory become folds in practice
- **Preserve your shove range**: Keep your shove range for premium hands (QQ+) and strong suited aces that have good equity when called

**The Stack Distribution Triangle**

Three stack sizes matter when you're considering a rejam from the blinds:
1. Your effective stack with the opener
2. Your effective stack with the caller
3. The big blind's stack (if you're in the small blind)

A hand like A4s can swing from +1.43bb of EV at 25bb to -0.27bb when the big blind covers you at 45bb. Why? The big blind wakes up with a hand more often in absolute terms, and when they do call, you're playing a 90bb pot instead of a 50bb pot—variance you can't afford with speculative holdings.

**Solution:** When the big blind covers you significantly, tighten to premium suited aces (A9s+), suited broadway combos (QTs+, KTs+, KJs+), and pairs 77+. Remove small suited aces and weak suited kings from your jamming range.

### Exploiting Unprotected Flatting Ranges (60bb+)

At 60bb, most players make a critical mistake: they 3-bet all their premiums (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK) and flat everything else. This creates a capped flatting range you can destroy.

**When You Identify This:**

From the small blind facing cutoff open and button flat at 60bb, you can jam:
- All suited aces
- Suited kings K5s+
- Suited queens Q9s+
- Suited connectors: JTs, T9s, J9s
- All pairs
- Strong offsuit combos

**The Mechanism**

When you jam JTs for 60bb, the button's continuing range is capped at TT, 99, AQs at most. They already 3-bet their premiums, so they're folding QJs, KQs, 99—hands that dominate you but aren't strong enough to call 60bb. You're essentially jamming into air with tremendous fold equity.

**Blocker Selection Matters at Depth**

- K6s > K8s (unblocks suited eights they're flatting)
- A4s > A9s (unblocks A9s-ATs they're 3-betting)
- T9s is a premium jam (unblocks KQ, KJ, QJ while blocking TT, 99)

You want hands that unblock their folding range while blocking their calling range.

**When Ranges Are Protected**

If an opponent slow-plays 50% of JJ, 50% of TT, 25% of QQ, your entire strategy collapses. That T9s jam that was +2.1bb plummets to -2.7bb. Solution: tighten dramatically to hands that either have equity when called (suited aces, suited kings) or block the trapping hands (KK, QQ block slow-plays). Remove suited connectors and one-gappers entirely.

### Shallow to Mid-Stack Blind vs Blind (25-40bb)

**Fast-Play Your Premiums**

Unlike at 100bb, at 25-40bb you should raise (not limp) the top of your range from the small blind:
- 25bb: Raise AA-TT, AK-AJ to 2.5-3x
- 30bb: Same approach
- 40bb: Same approach

At these depths, when you raise to 3bb and get called, the pot is 6bb with 22-37bb behind—a manageable SPR where you can realize your equity and get stacks in on favorable boards.

**Why the Strategy Inverts**

At 40bb, your opponent's isolation range becomes polarized. They're no longer raising-calling with K9s or T9s—they're shoving or folding those hands. This means your limp-raises with premiums get no action from the middling hands you want to play against. Better to raise directly and either take down the pot or play postflop with your equity advantage.

**Your New Raising Range Includes:**
- All premiums (AA-JJ, AK-AJ): These now raise directly
- Strong suited broadways (KQs-KTs, QJs-QTs)
- Gap connectors and weak suited kings: These become raise-fold candidates
- All pocket pairs: You want to see a flop in a raised pot

**When Limp-Jamming Works**

At 20-25bb, limp-jamming becomes viable with:
- Pocket pairs 44-66 (to avoid playing OOP against two overcards)
- Some weak suited aces (A2s-A5s)
- Offsuit ace-wheel (blocks calling hands, has equity when called)

You're exploiting the fact that the big blind will iso-raise hands like K9o, QJo, KTo—hands that will fold to a 16-20bb shove but would happily play postflop against your limp.

### Exploiting Oversized 3-Bets (30bb)

**The Setup**: You open from the button at 40bb. The small blind 3-bets to 7.3bb with a 30bb stack.

**Why This Is a Goldmine**

In equilibrium, players with 30bb should mostly be shoving or folding preflop—not making large 3-bets. When someone deviates by 3-betting big, they're telling you something crucial: they're polarized but weak. They have hands they don't want to jam (like King-Jack offsuit or Ace-Nine offsuit) and occasionally premium hands. But here's the key insight: it's extremely unlikely they're 3-betting aces or kings to 7.3bb. That's just not what players do.

**What to Do**

You can profitably 4-bet shove almost any two cards. Even 9-6 suited becomes massively profitable. The math is simple: you're shoving 29bb to win about 10bb (their 3-bet plus blinds and your open) when they fold, and when called, you often have decent equity.

**The Size Matters**

If that same opponent had 3-bet to 6bb instead of 7.3bb, your edge drops significantly. With the larger size, hands like Ace-Six suited go from making +2.15bb in EV to +3.17bb—an extra 1bb per hand simply because of the sizing. The larger their 3-bet, the more you print.

**What to Shove:**
- Any suited ace
- Any suited king
- Any suited queen
- Any broadway combination
- Any pair
- Many suited connectors

Don't overthink this spot. Players consistently underfold here because they can't believe Queen-Two suited is profitable. But your opponent is bluff-heavy by necessity—it's much easier for them to add King-Six suited or Queen-Ten offsuit than to add more premium value hands. When the sizing tells you they're weak, believe it.

### Sizing Against Shallow Blinds

**When the Big Blind Has 5bb or Less**

When facing a short-stacked big blind, your raise sizing should increase significantly. With a standard minraise, the big blind gets immediate pot odds to call with any two cards—their equity realization is maximized because they'll never face difficult postflop decisions.

By raising to 2.5x from the button (or 2.4x cutoff, 2.3x hijack, 2.2x middle position), you accomplish three things:

1. You force the big blind to fold roughly 20% of hands that were profitable calls against a minraise
2. You pressure the small blind with worse pot odds
3. You exploit the fact that most players' preflop charts are built for minraises

The larger sizing remains profitable even though it costs more when you're called because the fold equity gain outweighs the added risk. Population data reveals players fold 44% to a 2x open and 43% to a 2.5x open—they're completely inelastic to sizing. This means you're getting identical fold equity while winning more when they fold.

**Position-Based Sizing Adjustments:**
- **Button**: 2.5x (you have position and only the small blind can squeeze)
- **Cutoff**: 2.4x (button can still 3-bet)
- **Hijack**: 2.3x (three players behind increases squeeze risk)
- **Middle position**: 2.2x (most players still to act)

### Shallow Stack BvB Play (15-25bb)

**Population Exploits in the Small Blind**

Theory says don't shove much at 20bb. Reality? Players shove 24% of hands versus limps—more than three times optimal. They're jamming all suited aces, broadway combos, and pocket pairs when they should be constructing raise/fold ranges.

Your exploitation: Limp wider than theoretically optimal because opponents won't punish you. They're under-raising versus limps (14% actual versus 32% theoretical). Hands like QJs and KTs that get shoved on too much when you raise become profitable limps.

**Constructing Your Opening Strategy**

Your range needs three components:

1. **Shoves for value and protection**: Offsuit aces (blocks their calling range), small pairs 22-66 (can't play well postflop), suited wheel cards like 74s-T7s that make better hands fold while having equity when called

2. **Raises for polarization**: Strong hands (AA-TT, AK-ATs) that want value, plus bluff-raises with blockers (middling queens, kings, jacks with rag kickers—Q7o, K8o, J4o). These hands block their shove-calling range and play well in raised pots

3. **Limp/shove traps**: Medium pairs (77-99) that benefit when opponents over-isolate. When they raise your limp with their wide range, you shove and make K9o, A5s, and dominated pairs fold

**When Facing Raises**

At 20bb facing a 3bb raise, you need aggressive limp/shoves because population over-folds. They're not defending properly with hands like Q8o, J9o, or mid-suited connectors. Shove fives and sixes that don't benefit from their under-aggression. Shove sevens and eights if you expect folds.

### Push-Fold Ranges (5-15bb)

**Simple Rules of Thumb**

At 10bb from the small blind:
- **Suited hands**: Any ace, any king (even K2s). One high card is always a shove
- **Connected suited**: Anything touching (74s+). Fold only the worst disconnected suited hands
- **Offsuit hands**: Any king, any queen. Then jump down to J7o and go horizontal (J7o, T7o, 97o, 87o all shove; all 6x fold)
- **Pairs**: Everything 22-AA is a shove

From the big blind calling a 10bb shove:
- Any ace always calls
- Any suited king calls (K2s+)
- Offsuit kings need Q kicker (KQo+)
- Queens need 8 kicker (Q8o+)
- All mid-suited connectors call (T9s, J9s, Q9s)

The big jump when shoving is between queens and jacks. The big jump when calling is between kings and queens.

**With 5bb in the Big Blind**

When you have 5bb in the big blind facing a 15bb cutoff shove, you need far wider calls than intuition suggests. Call with any pair, any suited cards down to 72s, and offsuit hands down to 86o, Q7o, K5o.

The math: If you fold, you're down to 3.3bb after the next orbit. If you call and win, you're at 11.5bb. You need far less than 50% equity because of the stack size multiplier effect. On fast structures, doubling from 5bb to 11bb is worth far more than chip EV suggests—at 11bb you have playability; at 3bb you're just waiting to die.

### ICM Adjustments with Stack Imbalances

**As the Chip Leader**

With a commanding stack, expand aggressively. If theoretically opening 48% from the button at equal stacks, increase to 62%+ as chip leader. Add:
- Q5o, K3o, suited wheel cards
- Hands opponents can't profitably defend
- Bluff 3-bets with blocker hands (K9s, A7o) when facing resistance

Your opponents face tournament life decisions. Medium stacks can't call or reshove properly because busting costs them placement equity. Exploit this by raising wider and folding less to their shoves.

**Defending vs Chip Leader Aggression**

When a big stack opens 65%+ and you have 15-20bb, don't play standard. Shove or fold is often best. Your shoving range expands dramatically:

- All suited aces and kings (A2s+, K2s+)
- More offsuit broadways (KJo, KQo)
- All pairs 55+
- Connected suited hands (87s+)

Theory shows this is actually too tight against super-wide opens. You can add hands like A5o, K8o, and more suited connectors because chip leaders can't properly defend when they open so wide.

**The 3-Bet Call Innovation**

In high-pressure ICM spots, consider expanding your 3-bet calling range beyond just AA-QQ and AK. If you're a medium stack facing a big stack's button open, 3-betting then folding to shoves costs you chips without applying pressure. But 3-bet calling hands like AJs or AQs serves multiple purposes:

- Forces them to fold their weak 4-bet bluffs (A5s, K9s)
- Gets called by dominated aces (A9s, A8s) they'd fold to a shove
- Prevents them from printing money with any two cards
- Better than calling because you're out of position

If you only 3-bet call AA-KK, opponents can profitably 4-bet shove any ace because you're never calling. Widen to AQs-AJs and suddenly their A5o bluffs become unprofitable.

### Postflop at Shallow Depths

**BvB Continuation Betting**

Population drastically over-folds in blind battles. Versus a 1bb stab, players fold 46%. Versus turn double barrels, they over-fold. Your default: just stab any two cards. Check only premium hands or when you have clear check-raise value.

But notice the pattern shift: After betting flop and checking turn, players become stubborn on rivers (under-folding 30%+). Stop triple-barrel bluffing. Either check-give up or value-bet big.

**Size Selection Matters**

At 20bb effective, you're choosing between committing to pots or staying flexible. A min-raise to 2bb leaves room to fold. A 3x raise commits you more but generates folds. A shove ends all decisions.

Use small sizes with hands that want calls (premium pairs). Use shoves with hands that benefit from folds (weak aces, suited connectors). Use min-raises with polarized ranges that can handle both calls and reshoves.

## Practical Examples

**Example 1: Extracting Value at 100bb**

100bb effective, you have A♠A♣ in the small blind, button opens to 2.5bb.

**Wrong**: 3-bet to 10bb. When called, pot is 20.5bb with 87bb behind (4:1 SPR). You'll struggle to get stacks in except on perfect boards.

**Right**: Call. When the board comes T♠6♥3♦, the pot is 5.5bb. You check, they bet 3bb, you check-raise to 12bb. Now the pot is 20.5bb with 82bb behind and you're in a much better spot to stack worse top pairs, overpairs, and draws.

**Example 2: Mixed Stacks from the Button**

You're on the button with K♠Q♠ for 50bb. The cutoff (12bb) min-raises. The small blind has 30bb, big blind has 12bb.

**Wrong**: Call. The small blind will squeeze relentlessly, and even when you see a flop, the short stacks realize equity cheaply.

**Right**: 3-bet to 6bb. This polarizes action—the cutoff must shove or fold (and will fold hands like KTo, QJo that dominate you slightly), the blinds must play tight, and you take down the pot frequently. When called, your KQs has solid equity even if behind.

**Example 3: Big Blind Squeeze**

You're in the big blind with 8♥7♥ for 100bb. The button opens to 2.5bb, small blind calls.

**Population play**: Check or fold. "I don't want to bloat the pot OOP with a weak hand."

**Optimal play**: Squeeze to 12.5bb (5x). The small blind's flatting range is capped—it's full of hands like QTo, KJo, suited kings, small pairs, and suited connectors. When you squeeze, the button folds frequently (they opened wide), and the small blind folds most of their range. When called, you have position on the small blind and can barrel favorable boards.

**Example 4: The 4-Bet Shove Goldmine**

You open button to 2.5bb with K♠5♠ at 40bb. Small blind (30bb) 3-bets to 7.3bb.

Many players fold here, thinking "King-five, even suited, can't be good." But look at the math: you're shoving 29bb to win approximately 10.3bb when they fold. Given that they're polarized and unlikely to have premiums (who 3-bets aces to 3.8x?), they're folding over 60% of the time. When called, you have around 35-40% equity against their range of medium pairs and ace-X hands.

**Correct play**: Snap 4-bet jam and print money.

**Example 5: Navigating Mixed Stacks from the Button**

Cutoff (21bb) opens to 2bb. You're on button with J♠T♠ at 35bb. Small blind has 46bb, big blind has 40bb.

At 20bb effective, this is a mandatory shove. But here? You should call. The blinds can't squeeze as aggressively (risking 35bb+ is serious), and Jack-Ten suited plays beautifully in position postflop. By calling, you incentivize the blinds to overcall with weak hands, building pots where you have position and playability.

**Example 6: 20bb BvB Exploitation**

You're in the small blind with 9♠8♠ at 20bb effective. Population over-shoves versus limps (24% actual versus 7% theoretical) but under-raises (14% versus 32%).

Theory suggests sometimes shoving. But against this population, limping is superior. When they raise, you can limp-call profitably because they're not polarized enough—they're raising hands like KJo and QTs that you have equity against. When they check back, you've realized equity cheaply. When they over-shove, you fold correctly.

**Example 7: Short Stack Big Blind Defense**

You have 5bb in the big blind. The 15bb cutoff shoves.

- **With T5s**: Call. You have ~38% equity against their range (pairs, Ax, broadway), getting better than 2:1
- **With 94s**: Call. Any suited cards play well enough given your price
- **With K4o**: Call. You're getting nearly 3:1 and have two live cards against most of their range

## Implementation Checklist

**Before Your Next Session:**

- Review your stats: Are you calling too much when deep stacked instead of limp-raising with premiums?
- Set mental rules: At 100bb+, limp AA-TT from small blind; at 25-40bb, raise them
- Memorize push-fold charts for 5bb, 10bb, 15bb—know the "jump" levels (suited any-ace at 10bb; when shoving use J7o as the horizontal line)
- Identify fish and note their limp frequency—adjust isolation sizing and ranges
- Track how often each blind 3-bets—expand or contract your steal ranges based on real frequencies

**During Play:**

- Every hand, identify stack sizes clockwise from you before action reaches you
- When a shorter stack opens and you're deep, immediately think: "3-bet or fold, cannot call"
- Against mixed stacks, identify the shortest effective stack first—this dictates your strategy
- In the blinds deep stacked, resist the urge to fast-play premiums—engineer limp-raises instead
- From the big blind against button open + small blind call, mark 5-10 hands (87s, 76s, JTs, A6o) as "auto-squeeze"
- When you're the short stack, lean toward min-raise rather than shove—preserve your option to fold
- Against shallow blinds (5bb or less), use 2.5x sizing from button—widen your opening range
- Default to stabbing any two cards in limped BvB pots—check only with traps
- Track stack sizes constantly—know when you cross 15bb, 10bb, and 5bb thresholds where strategy shifts dramatically

**ICM Situations:**

- As chip leader: Open 60%+ from button with ANY stack behind you under 25bb, add bluff 3-bets with blocker hands
- As medium stack versus chip leader: Shove or fold is default; 3-bet calling with AQ-AJ if they're opening 60%+
- Near bubble/final table: Expand shove ranges by 20-30% because opponents over-fold; tighten calling ranges slightly because they shove tighter

**Post-Session Review:**

- Filter hands where effective stacks were mixed—did you adjust properly?
- Review big blind defense versus button—are you calling enough suited junk and squeezing enough?
- Check your limp-raise frequency at 100bb—should be 3-5% of hands, mostly premiums
- Look at hands where you called behind a short stack open—these should mostly be folds or 3-bets
- Did you fold to aggression at 15-20bb when you could have profitably shoved? What blockers did you have?
- Review your limp-behind decisions: Did opponents over-attack (limp less) or under-attack (limp more)?
- Check your continuation betting: Are you stabbing enough in BvB? Are you triple-barreling too much when they show turn weakness?
- Identify spots where you folded hands like T4s with 5bb facing a shove—these are mistakes
- When you isolated suited connectors with short st

# Chapter 5: Live Play Sessions

## Overview

Welcome to where theory collides with reality. This chapter drops you into actual tournament action—multiple tables running simultaneously, real money on the line, and split-second decisions that separate consistent winners from eternal hopefuls. You'll see how concepts adapt when you're juggling stack sizes, reading opponents in real time, and managing the mental chaos of high-pressure play. This isn't a highlight reel of perfect decisions—it's the messy, instructive reality of tournament poker where mistakes happen, adjustments matter, and process trumps results.

## Core Principles

**Live Play Demands Contextual Thinking**

Every decision exists in a web of interconnected factors: your stack relative to blinds, your position in the payout structure, who's sitting where, and how previous hands shape current perceptions. A standard cutoff open with queen-ten offsuit becomes completely different when you're chip leader on the bubble versus short-stacked at a final table. Stop thinking in isolation—start thinking in context.

**ICM Pressure Creates Exploitable Dynamics**

When pay jumps loom, players transform. Short stacks become desperately tight or recklessly loose. Medium stacks play scared, protecting their ladder position. Big stacks either abuse their leverage or waste it playing cautiously. Your job: identify which players are responding correctly to ICM pressure and which are making systematic errors you can exploit.

Understanding ICM isn't about memorizing push-fold charts—it's about recognizing when opponents' tournament lives create friction between optimal play and self-preservation instinct. When two short stacks face each other with you in between, they're incentivized to avoid confrontation. That's your stealing window.

**Player Profiling Drives Everything**

The solver might recommend one line, but when you're facing a recreational player who opens 40% from early position and snap-calls with middle pair, GTO becomes a liability. Your edge comes from pattern recognition: the amateur who raise-folds too much, the aggressive regular pushing bounty edges, the nit waiting for premiums.

Mark players not by skill level but by tendencies. "Aggressive or passive?" "Loose or tight?" "Does he check-raise or just call?" These categories matter more than whether he's "good" or "bad." Elite players and break-even players often get the same color tag because what matters is *how they play specific spots*, not their overall win rate.

**Process Over Perfection**

Multi-tabling eight tournaments while explaining your thought process, you'll miss-click and fold jack-seven suited on the button. That's reality. The goal isn't robotic perfection—it's making +EV decisions consistently while managing mental load. Accept that you'll make mistakes. Review them later. Don't let one error cascade into tilt.

## Key Strategies

### Stack-Based Range Adjustments

Your strategy must evolve constantly based on three variables: your stack size relative to blinds, your position in the payout structure, and who covers whom.

**Deep Stack Play (50+ Big Blinds)**

With room to maneuver, prioritize playability over high cards. Suited connectors gain value in multiway pots with implied odds. King-six offsuit loses value because domination becomes expensive. Against aggressive opponents, use smaller sizing on dry flops (25-33% pot) with your entire range—this prevents check-raises while maintaining betting frequency.

Open wider from late position when opponents are scared—especially near bubbles when medium stacks face ICM pressure. With 70 big blinds on the button against fearful blinds, queen-seven offsuit becomes a profitable steal. You're not playing the cards; you're playing the situation.

**The check-back trap** becomes powerful here. On paired boards when you check the flop in position, you're setting up delayed aggression. If the turn goes check-check, bet small on the river with everything—bluffs get better prices, and their weak pairs become impossible calls. After checking twice, opponents assume weakness, making even 20% pot bets highly effective.

**Medium Stack Play (25-45 Big Blinds)**

This is tournament purgatory—too deep to shove, too shallow to see many flops. Shift toward polarized play: open aggressively from late position but give up quickly when facing resistance unless you have genuine strength.

Against loose openers from late position near bubbles, three-bet non-all-in with hands that fold out dominated holdings. Queen-jack suited makes king-jack, king-ten, and queen-ten fold while maintaining equity against reshoves. Size it 2.5-3x their open—large enough they can't profitably flat, small enough you can fold to reshoves.

**With threatening medium stacks**, sometimes you're actually the most dangerous player at the table. You're one double-up from chip lead, which means you can embrace variance that bigger stacks must avoid. Use this leverage: three-bet chip leaders who can't four-bet light without risking their comfortable position.

**Short Stack Play (12-20 Big Blinds)**

Shift to simplified strategies. Instead of complex call/fold ranges facing opens, implement primarily shove-or-fold with occasional high-equity calls.

From the button facing a loose hijack open, shove king-five suited with 15 big blinds. You fold out dominated kings (king-nine through king-jack), all weak aces (ace-deuce through ace-nine), and medium pairs that can't call (sevens through nines). When called, you still have 30-40% equity against typical calling ranges.

**Avoid calling with intention to "see a flop"** at these depths. You don't have implied odds, you face constant reshove pressure, and you're burning precious big blinds without realizing equity. The math demands aggression.

**Critical Stack (8-12 Big Blinds)**

Move into full push-fold mode. From small blind when folded to, shove any two cards. The big blind needs roughly 35% equity to call profitably, and even when called, you have about 30% equity with random hands. With mounting blinds and antes, folding costs 10-15% of your stack.

The time to be aggressive is *before* you're desperate. If you wait from 12 big blinds to 8 to 5, you lose all fold equity and become a calling station for opponents.

### Exploiting Tournament Dynamics

**Bubble Leverage**

Proximity to money creates exploitable fear. Players with 15-20 big blinds desperately want to cash, making them vulnerable from late position when you cover them.

Attack relentlessly when you identify scared money, but intelligently. Focus aggression on:
- Players with 20-40 big blinds (enough to hurt, but terrified to bust)
- Opens from early position into your blinds (they're range-capped)
- Multi-way pots where everyone's checking to each other

Avoid tangling with other big stacks unnecessarily. That player with 70 big blinds covering you? He's not folding to your pressure. Target the scared money.

When you're short-stacked on the bubble, surrender your blinds more liberally. King-ten offsuit in big blind facing a button open? Just fold. Your tournament life is worth more than defending marginal hands. Wait for legitimate reshove spots—ace-x suited, any pocket pair, broadway cards.

**Post-Bubble Explosion**

The 5-10 minutes after the bubble bursts is poker's most volatile phase. Players with 4-8 big blinds who were waiting suddenly shove any two. Big stacks attack relentlessly. Your strategy with a medium stack? Stay out of it.

Watch other tables. When players double through each other, let them. Every time someone else busts, you climb the payout ladder without risking a chip. This "future game" thinking—where EV from preservation exceeds EV from accumulation—is where disciplined players separate themselves.

**Final Table Adjustments**

Dynamics shift dramatically. Players who gambled loose on the bubble suddenly tighten when pay jumps matter. Conversely, short stacks realize they need chips and start taking stands.

With a big stack at final tables, stay tight initially. Let short stacks eliminate each other while you preserve your chip lead. Only after 2-3 eliminations should you resume aggressive play. Position matters more here—being on the button or cutoff with a medium stack is worth significantly more than being under the gun with the same chips.

**Recognize stack groups**: When stacks cluster together (four players at 1.7 million, three at 2.7 million), you're in ICM prison if you're in the lower group. Getting to 2.2 million separates you and allows you to apply pressure to those 1.7 million stacks who remain paralyzed. Sometimes a slightly -EV spot is worth taking to escape stack group prison.

### Bounty Tournament Strategy

Progressive knockout tournaments fundamentally alter correct strategy because covering opponents changes everything.

**When you cover opponents**, widen your shoving range dramatically. Ace-four suited becomes a profitable three-bet shove at 25 big blinds because even when behind in equity, bounty value compensates. You're not just playing for chips—you're playing for immediate cash.

Against a covered opponent opening loose from late position with bubble pressure, three-bet non-all-in with hands like king-six suited. You fold out better hands that can't handle pressure while maintaining equity if called. Opponents must risk their entire stack while you're risking a fraction of yours, plus you realize bounty value.

**When covered**, tighten ranges because opponents know they have bounty incentive to gamble. That button open from a player covering you? He's opening 60% because knocking you out pays directly. Adjust by folding marginal king-highs and weak aces you'd normally defend.

**Calculate "coverage odds"**: Before making decisions, ask: "If I double, who do I cover?" Doubling from 1.5 million to 3 million chips might cover 2-4 players, transforming you from bounty victim to bounty threat. This changes entire table dynamics and often justifies wider calling ranges than chip EV alone suggests.

### Reading and Exploiting Player Types

Opponents cluster into exploitable patterns:

**Big Pot Players** love action preflop but overfold in small pots. They limp, call raises, and wait to make hands. Against them, fire frequent small continuation bets on boards where they'll miss—they fold queen-high and weak pairs surprisingly often. Save big confrontations for when you have genuine strength.

**Small Pot Players** (typically stronger regulars) accumulate through aggression, preferring pressure over showdowns. Against them, call more, raise less, and look for check-raise spots when they inevitably continuation bet. Let them hang themselves with their aggression.

**Aggressive Three-Bettors**: When facing maniacs who three-bet relentlessly, counterintuitively tighten your opening range. Save marginal opens for when they're not in position on you. When they do open, flat-call with hands like ace-queen or pocket nines rather than four-betting—this keeps their weak hands in and allows postflop skill edges.

**Tight Passive Players**: Against nits, delay bluffs until later streets. Check-check-check through flop and turn, then bet river. This works because weak-tight opponents always bet made hands quickly. By the river, their range becomes extremely capped—they have nothing or they'd have bet earlier.

### Advanced Bet Sizing

Your bet sizes shouldn't be fixed—they should respond to board texture, your range advantage, opponent tendencies, and ICM pressure.

**Small Sizing for Range Advantage**

On boards that heavily favor your range (king-six-three rainbow after you opened button), bet 25-30% pot. Villain faces impossible defense frequency requirements—they need to continue 60%+ but simply don't have enough hands. Pairs below the king can't profitably continue, and you set up profitable turn barrels.

**Polarized Large Bets**

Use 75-150% pot sizing on turns and rivers when you're polarized—both value hands and bluffs, nothing in between. On a king-eight-four flop you c-bet, when a blank turns, fire large with both your sets/two-pairs AND your gutshots with backdoor draws. Your opponent must fold decent pairs or risk tournament life, while you maintain genuine value in this range.

**Common mistake**: Over-bluffing this line without enough value hands, or using this sizing when out of position where check-raises are more likely.

**The Blocking Bet**

After check-calling flop and turn, facing rivers where you beat bluffs but lose to value, bet 25-33% pot. This prevents opponents from checking back better hands that wouldn't call larger bets, extracts value from worse showdown hands like lower pairs, and stops them from betting you off equity.

**ICM-Leveraged Sizing**

As chip leader, bet amounts that would make opponents the shortest stack if they call and lose. If an opponent has 25 big blinds in second place and calling would drop them to fifth if they lose, bet 17 big blinds. The ICM pressure of potentially falling multiple spots makes even strong hands difficult to continue with.

### Turn and River Execution

Later streets separate winners from also-rans because ranges are defined and decisions carry maximum weight.

**Turn Barreling with Blockers**

When you continuation bet and get called, evaluate turn barrels through the lens of blockers and equity. With ace-nine of clubs on a king-eight-four (two clubs) flop, you c-bet 3 big blinds, they call. Turn queen of clubs.

Bet 12 big blinds into 9 big blinds (133% pot). You can credibly have ace-king, king-queen, sets, and nut flushes. Your ace-nine has nut flush draw equity plus two overcards to eights and fours. Even tight players must fold king-ten, and aggressive players might raise as bluff, giving you great price to call with your draw.

**Turn Check-Raises for Protection**

When you call flop c-bet with vulnerable hands and turn brings equity, check-raising can be superior to check-calling or leading. You defend with ace-queen suited, flop comes king-eight-four with one of your suit. You call small c-bet. Turn brings seven of your suit, giving you flush draw.

Check with intention to raise their turn bet. This protects equity against hands that would barrel you off the river, gets value from worse pairs that won't call three streets, and looks bluffy because you just called flop.

**River Decision Trees**

Rivers demand you construct your opponent's range backward from their line.

**Against river overbets**, ask: "Does this sizing make sense for the nuts?" When an opponent bets 150% pot after a passive line, they're usually polarized to extreme value or complete air. The sizing itself becomes information—nuts would often bet smaller to induce, while strong-but-not-nuts hands fear raises.

With marginal bluff-catchers, evaluate blockers ruthlessly. Holding king-queen on a king-high board after calling down, you block some value combinations (king-jack becomes impossible) but also block bluffs (queen-jack straight draws). When you block more bluffs than value, folding becomes correct even at good prices.

**Thin river value** requires balanced ranges. If you're bluffing some percentage of rivers (which you should be with missed draws), you need thin value bets to balance. Ace-king on a king-high board might seem obvious, but if you've checked multiple streets, betting becomes mandatory to balance your bluffs—even though it loses to very few hands.

### Multi-Street Bluffing

Turning hands into bluffs across multiple streets requires planning and blockers.

**Choose bluffs that block calling hands, not folding hands**. On a ten-seven-four-king-deuce runout where you checked back king-eight on the turn, your king blocks king-queen, king-jack (hands that might call). Your eight doesn't block straight draws that gave up. This makes king-eight a better river bluff than ace-nine despite ace-high being "stronger."

**Delayed aggression patterns** work because they're unexpected. Check-call flop, check-call turn, then bomb river. This looks like you were trapping or a draw completed. Opponents struggle to put you on this line as a bluff, making folds more likely.

**Semi-bluff equity matters less as pots get large**. With gutshots and overcards on the flop, continuing makes sense. By the river when you miss, your equity is zero—but that doesn't mean checking. Your fold equity is actually higher because you've represented strength throughout, and opponents face maximum pressure with one-pair hands.

### Short-Handed and Heads-Up Adjustments

When tables break and you're six-handed or fewer, ranges shift dramatically.

**Six-Handed Play**

From the button, open 55-60% of hands when folded to you, especially against weak blinds. Nine-seven suited is standard. King-nine offsuit is fine. You're not hoping to make a hand—you're applying pressure and playing position.

Against aggressive small blinds who three-bet frequently, develop a raise-call range with hands like ace-jack and pocket nines. Don't fold every time they squeeze. Make them prove they have it.

**Three-Handed Dynamics**

Stack relationships dominate strategy. When two short stacks sit behind you, they're in prisoner's dilemma—both want the other to bust first. Exploit this by opening aggressively, knowing neither wants confrontation with the other lurking.

With similar stacks, avoid each other unless battling for chip lead creates strategic advantages. You're not trying to eliminate players your size—you want short stacks to bust while you preserve position.

**Heads-Up Strategy**

Ranges expand to near-maximum width. From button, you're opening 80%+ of hands. The key shift: aggressive limping becomes viable because it disguises your range and prevents opponents from applying maximum pressure.

**Limp your playable-but-vulnerable hands**: King-seven offsuit, ten-six suited, small pairs. These hands flop okay but hate getting raised. Limping lets you see flops cheaply, disguises strength, and prevents opponents from applying pressure.

**Jam your premium range**: Ace-x suited, broadway cards, medium pairs. These hands play poorly postflop in bloated pots but have great equity against calling ranges.

**The inducement principle**: Sometimes making hands look weaker extracts more value than showing strength. When opponents expect you to shove certain hands, three-betting smaller can induce them to reshove hands they'd fold to a shove—particularly when they think you're trying to steal with position.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: ICM Pressure Exploitation

**Setup**: Final table bubble, you're third in chips with 42 big blinds. Button (chip leader with 120 big blinds) opens, you're in big blind with ace-five offsuit.

**Decision**: Three-bet to 10 big blinds instead of calling.

**Reasoning**: The chip leader has everything to lose. If they four-bet, you can fold having invested only 10. If they call, you play a three-bet pot with leverage—you can jam many flops and they must consider ICM implications with marginal hands. If they fold, you win immediately.

**Result**: After three-betting, flop came jack-six-three rainbow. You bet half pot. Chip leader folded king-queen face-up. The pressure of the situation combined with your perceived polarized range generated a fold from the best hand.

### Example 2: Bounty Leverage Shove

**Setup**: You have ace-nine suited covering an opponent's 18 big blind stack on the button. He opens from cutoff. You know he'll open wide because of his stack pressure.

**Decision**: Three-bet jam.

**Reasoning**: He should fold hands like king-jack, queen-jack that have decent equity because he's risking tournament life. But you're getting immediate value from his bounty even when called by better aces, plus you have fold equity. In a non-bounty format this loses chips, but with bounty value it's significantly +EV.

**Result**: He folds ace-eight face-up, frustrated but correct given ICM implications.

### Example 3: Turn Geometry and Blockers

**Setup**: You open queen-seven suited from button, big blind calls. Flop ace-five-three with two of your suit. He checks, you bet 40% pot, he calls. Turn nine of your suit, completing your flush. He checks.

**Decision**: Bet 133% pot (12 big blinds into 9).

**Reasoning**: You can credibly represent ace-king, ace-queen, sets, and flushes after this line. Opponent has many weak aces that now fear the nine, plus all their pocket pairs face maximum pressure. Your queen-seven has nut flush plus blockers to some value hands opponent might call with.

**Result**: He tank-folds ace-ten, correctly reading your line as polarized but unable to beat your value range.

### Example 4: Small Stack Patience

**Setup**: Four-handed, you're second in chips with 60 big blinds. Chip leader has 100, third has 40, fourth has 20. You have jack-nine suited in cutoff.

**Decision**: Fold to potential action.

**Reasoning**: Three hands later, one short stack busted. You gained \$3,000+ in tournament equity by folding. If you'd played and lost to either opponent, you'd go from second to potentially third or fourth. By folding and letting collision effects work, you guaranteed moving up without risk.

**The principle**: ICM sometimes makes folds with decent hands more profitable than playing them, especially when short stacks are likely to collide soon anyway.

### Example 5: Blocking River Bluff

**Setup**: You open button with jack-four offsuit, big blind calls. Flop ace-nine-deuce rainbow. He checks, you c-bet 40% pot, he calls. Turn six. He checks, you check back. River king bringing backdoor flush.

**Decision**: Bet 60% pot when he checks to you.

**Reasoning**: Your jack blocks jack-ten, jack-nine (hands he might have called flop with). You have no flush card, so flush draws are more likely in his range than in yours. The ace on board gives you credibility for big hands you'd check turn with (ace-x, king-king).

**Result**: He tanks and folds, showing ace-ten. Your blockers and credible line made him fold what was actually best—but your analysis was sound because most of his range in this spot is weak aces that fold to pressure.

### Example 6: The Disciplined Fold

**Setup**: You defend big blind with king-jack suited against button open. Board runs ace-six-three-jack-queen. You check-call flop and turn. River he bombs for 150% pot.

**Decision**: Fold.

**Reasoning**: His line makes no sense for a bluff. Checking flop would make sense with strong value, but then double-barreling unfavorable runouts doesn't. This represents exactly what it is: slow-played strength now value-betting. Nuts-or-air hands would have bet the flop. Your second pair, despite being decent, loses to too much of the range that takes this specific line.

**The lesson**: Results-oriented thinking destroys tournament ROI. Correct folds often feel bad when you would have won, but the decision quality is what matters.

## Implementation Checklist

**Pre-Session Preparation**
- Review tournament structures and identify where pay jumps create maximum ICM pressure
- Note which opponents are likely to be ICM-aware versus chip-accumulation focused
- Set stack thresholds for switching strategies (deep/medium/short/critical)
- Identify final table and bubble approaching to mentally prepare for strategy shifts

**Multi-Tabling Management**
- Standardize early-stage decisions to preserve mental energy for critical spots
- Accept you'll make occasional mistakes—focus on process, not perfection
- Allocate attention based on tournament stage: bubble/final table demands more focus than early play
- Mark interesting hands for later review rather than dwelling on them in-session

**Stack-Based Adjustments**
- With 50+ big blinds: prioritize playability, open wider from late position, use small bet sizing on favorable boards
- With 25-45 big blinds: shift toward polarization, three-bet with blockers, avoid marginal confrontations
- With 12-20 big blinds: simplify to shove-or-fold in most spots, maintain aggression before desperation
- With 8-12 big blinds: shove any two from small blind, accept variance, target opponents with time pressure

**Position and Coverage Dynamics**
- Note who covers whom before every hand—this determines aggression levels
- Expand ranges when covering scared medium stacks near bubbles
- Tighten when covered by aggressive players incentivized by bounties
- Use position ruthlessly: button and cutoff are profit centers, early position requires discipline

**Bet Sizing Strategy**
- Small bets (25-30% pot): range advantage boards, protection bets, blocking rivers
- Standard bets (50-66% pot): most continuation bets and value bets
- Large bets (75-100% pot): turn bets on wet boards, polarized river spots
- Overbets (125%+ pot): river bluffs with blockers, thin value when ranges capped

**Player Type Exploitation**
- Against big pot players: small bet frequently, save big pots for value
- Against small pot players: call more, let them bluff, check-raise when they barrel
- Against aggressive three-bettors: tighten opens, flat-call more, trap occasionally
- Against tight passive players: delay bluffs to rivers, apply pressure late in hands

**ICM Adjustments**
- Approaching bubbles: expand steals against scared medium stacks, surrender blinds when short
- Post-bubble explosion: stay tight with medium stacks, let others collide
- Final tables: wait for eliminations before resuming aggression, recognize stack groups
- Heads-up/short-handed: expand ranges dramatically, simplify to limp-or-jam with short stacks

**Turn and River Execution**
- Turn barrels: evaluate blockers and equity, polarize with large sizes when appropriate
- River bluffs: choose hands that block value, not bluffs; ensure line makes sense
- River value: balance with bluffing frequency, use blockers to determine calling ranges
- River bluff-catching: calculate what you block and unblock before hero calling

**Bounty Tournament Specifics**
- When covering: widen jamming ranges significantly, calculate bounty EV into every decision
- When covered: tighten because opponents have extra incentive to gamble
- Coverage odds: always consider what doubling does for who you can cover
- Multi-way spots: sometimes checking allows others to collect bounties for you

**Mental Game Management**
- Process bad beats in under 5 seconds—acknowledge, release, refocus
- No emotional response to winning flips or getting it in good
- Accept that correct folds feel bad when you would have won
- When card-dead, focus on exploiting opponent tendencies rather than forcing action
- Save mental energy for high-leverage spots rather than treating every decision equally

**Post-Session Review**
- Identify spots where you waited too long to get aggressive with short stacks
- Review hands where ICM made you fold strong hands—verify correctness
- Analyze whether your bet sizing matched your strategic goals
- Examine timing tells from opponents—which proved accurate for future exploitation
- Track collision effects where folding gained you pay jumps without risk

Live play sessions reveal the gap between knowing what to do and executing under pressure. You'll make mistakes. You'll face variance. You'll lose pots you played perfectly. None of that matters. What matters is recognizing patterns faster than opponents, adjusting to contexts they miss, and maintaining disciplined aggression when ICM pressure makes others timid. Master the ability to shift gears as stack sizes change, exploit players who can't, and you'll transform final table appearances into final table victories.

# Chapter 6: Guest Expert Reviews

## Overview

Learning from elite players reveals as much about your own game as it does about theirs. In this chapter, you'll analyze hands with top mid-stakes and high-stakes crushers, exploring sophisticated concepts like multi-way pot dynamics, ICM considerations in bounty builders, exploitative adjustments, and final table warfare. The key isn't just learning what the experts do—it's understanding the thinking process behind their decisions and developing the mental frameworks that separate competent players from crushers.

## Core Principles

**Study the process, not just the outcome.** The most valuable learning comes from understanding *why* elite players make specific decisions. When Patrick Brooks advocates a turn overbet with kings, he's not showing off—he's thinking about which hands in his range need maximum pressure and how sizing shapes the entire hand. When Michael Adamo opens King-7 offsuit from the hijack, he's exploiting ICM pressure that forces opponents into impossible situations. Focus on their reasoning, not memorizing their plays.

**Structure dictates strategy more than cards.** GG tournaments start at 26 big blinds and deteriorate rapidly, demanding relentless preflop precision. PokerStars deep-stack events at 200+ big blinds require sophisticated pot control and delayed aggression. PSGO bounty dynamics create cash game-like conditions even with severe ICM pressure. Understanding which skills matter most in your specific format determines where you should invest study time.

**Every size tells a story.** Bet sizing isn't about solver precision—it's about understanding what you're trying to accomplish. Are you making King-Queen offsuit indifferent? Folding out dominated flush draws? Keeping in worse pairs while denying equity to overcards? Your sizing should answer: "Which specific hands in my opponent's range am I targeting, and what's the smallest bet that accomplishes this goal?"

**ICM pressure creates exploitable patterns.** At final tables, universal fear of elimination creates massive opportunities. Most players respond by tightening up dramatically, checking when they should bet, folding when they should call. The best players recognize these specific stack configurations and exploit them ruthlessly—squeezing when short stacks create protection, forward-shoving when polarized three-bets trap dead money, opening absurdly wide when opponents can't defend.

## Key Strategies

### Preflop Precision in Shallow Structures

Nineteen-year-old Scandinavian pro Ceis built his bankroll from \$20 to regular \$530 games in one year by mastering one crucial skill: preflop precision in shallow structures. While others studied exotic postflop overbet strategies, he ground ICMIZER and HRC simulations until he knew exactly which hands to shove, call, or fold within single-combo accuracy.

**The fundamental reality:** In GG tournaments where 70% of decisions happen under 30 big blinds, studying 100bb cutoff vs button 3-bet pots wastes time. Your edge comes from knowing that Ace-7 offsuit is a marginal call against a 17bb button shove (depends on small blind's stack), that Jack-Ten suited outperforms 88 as a reshove in shallow spots, and that suited broadway hands should be prioritized over small pairs when reshoving 15-20bb.

**Why suited connectors dominate small pairs:** When you reshove 17bb with 88, you get called by better pairs and race against overs. When you reshove with Jack-Ten suited, you fold out dominating hands (King-Jack, Queen-Jack) and get called by ranges that don't dominate you as heavily. Against realistic calling ranges, Jack-Ten suited makes 7% more than 88 as a reshove—but postflop, 88 plays better because you either have an overpair or don't, minimizing reverse implied odds.

**The Day 2 adjustment:** Most players make a critical mistake at Day 2 start, playing too tight because they fired 5-6 bullets to get there. But you're 100 spots from the money with 25bb—if you fold your way in, you'll have 6bb and min-cash. Early Day 2, play nearly chip EV. Take thin +EV spots. Don't preserve your tournament life at the expense of chip accumulation. The real money is in reaching the final table with a stack.

**Discipline over brilliance:** Ceis's approach to bankroll management reveals why technical skill alone isn't enough. After his first \$62K score, he continued playing \$50-80 ABI. During downswings, he drops to Pacific Rim morning schedules—smaller fields, more final tables, healthier sleep—and increases study time on weak areas. He treats a \$30K roll the same way he treated \$300. This patience compounds more than any solver knowledge.

### Exploiting Bounty Builder Dynamics

PSGO tournaments demand dramatically different strategies than freezeouts. The bounty creates action, and you need to be the one driving it—but most players approach these spots backwards.

**The squeeze opportunity:** When a short stack opens and gets called, most players recognize this as a premium squeeze spot—but they don't squeeze. The fundamental tension is this: opponents defend too wide preflop (they don't want to fold and miss bounty opportunities) yet fail to squeeze enough themselves (they can profitably call in position). This creates massive exploitation opportunities.

When you squeeze in these spots, you're not gambling—you're exploiting universal timidity. The short stack will tighten up significantly against the squeeze (they fast-play premiums and never slow-play aces/kings against short stacks). The caller is trapped with a capped range of mostly suited connectors and medium pairs. Your squeeze looks strong, appears committed against the short stack, and targets a range that's extremely face-up. Yet most players flat-call because "people don't squeeze." Be the player who does.

**The bounty factor at final tables:** In Bounty Builders, massive bounties create cash game-like conditions even with severe ICM pressure. When someone has a 20bb bounty, you're essentially getting 2:1 on your money even in bad spots. This changes everything about preflop ranges.

Against opens from players with huge bounties who cover the table, their ranges are drastically wider—any suited ace, any king, any pocket pair. Don't jam Ace-7 offsuit for 40bb (they're not folding enough). Instead, expand your flatting range with suited connectors and medium pairs that play well postflop. At 15bb effective, you can call hands like Ace-Jack offsuit that would normally be 3-bet-or-fold. You're incentivized to see flops because your opponent's range is so wide and they're unlikely to apply optimal pressure postflop.

**Coverage principles:** In PKOs where you cover an opponent, call wider—not just because of the bounty, but because they know you cover and will likely be opening wider. The raiser knows they cover players behind and can punish them more, so they're opening any suited ace, medium kings, small pairs. You're not calling because your hand is good—you're calling because their range is wider than it should be given stack dynamics, and you have position postflop against a likely weak range.

### Dynamic Board Bet Sizing

Stop thinking about bet sizes as "small, medium, large." Think about them as tools that target specific hand classes based on board texture and your range advantage.

**On disconnected boards (King-2-3 rainbow):** Your opponent misses dramatically with offsuit high cards. Use 25-33% pot sizing. You don't need to make hands indifferent—they're just folding. Small bets accomplish the same goal as large bets but risk less when you're bluffing and get called more when you have it.

**On connected boards with flush draws (King-8-5 two-tone):** When you're polarized and the board connects with offsuit broadway, use larger sizing—around 50-75% pot. Target hands like King-Queen offsuit, King-Jack offsuit, and dominated flush draws. Your sizing should answer: "What's the smallest bet that makes King-Queen fold?"

**On ace-high boards:** Size up because players defend more stubbornly with any piece of the ace. They'll call smaller bets too liberally, so charge them. This is especially true when the ace completes obvious draws—opponents become suspicious and sticky.

**The turn paradox:** When you bet large on the flop, size down on the turn unless trying to fold out better hands. After a 65% flop c-bet with pocket jacks on King-9-6, the turn brings a blank four. Your instinct might be to keep hammering, but ask: what are you trying to make indifferent? Hands like Ace-Queen are already folding. Hands like King-Queen are never folding to reasonable sizes. The sweet spot is hands like Queen-Ten suited and weak backdoor flush draws that called the flop. Use 30-35% pot to fold these out while allowing you to bet three streets comfortably with overpairs.

**The protection trap:** Players massively overestimate how much they need to bet for "protection." On ultra-dynamic boards, smaller turn bets with the intention to bluff rivers often generate more fold equity than turn shoves. When you check-raise six-four offsuit on King-6-4 and the turn brings a queen with double flush draws, the lazy play is shoving. The sophisticated play is betting small—you're not protecting against a king (if villain has it, you're dead anyway). You're keeping in worse flush draws, allowing him to float with ace-high again, and setting up a river shove that folds out more equity. Your jam makes his decisions easy; your small bet makes them hard.

### Multi-Way Pot Mechanics

When you're facing multiple opponents, your betting strategy shifts dramatically. You're no longer building pots—you're protecting equity against multiple draws while keeping bluffs credible.

**The micro-betting principle:** When facing multiple opponents with draw-heavy ranges, use 10-20% pot bets with hands that need protection but can't withstand aggression. On Queen-9-4 with pocket tens facing two opponents heavy on suited connectors, bet just 15% pot. You're not trying to fold out draws—you're charging them while keeping your bluffs cheap. If they call your micro-bet, they're probably weak. Keep charging.

**Position-relative range dynamics:** Your betting frequency should be inversely proportional to how close an opponent sits to your left. When someone directly on your left calls, they typically have a stronger, condensed range that dominates your offsuit combos. Against the button when you're earlier? Check heavily. Against late position far from you? Bet aggressively.

**The offsuit combo read:** On every disconnected flop, ask: "What offsuit combos does my opponent have that connect?" On Queen-Jack-4 after a button open, he has all King-Queen, Queen-Jack, Ace-Queen, King-Jack offsuit—connects well, so check more. On 9-7-2, he doesn't have 97, 92, 72 offsuit—connects poorly, so bet more. Count the offsuit combos that hit. More than 12? Check-heavy. Fewer than 8? Bet-heavy.

**When third players change everything:** When there's a shallow third player at the table, conventional wisdom breaks down. If you have Jack-Ten suited with a flush draw in a three-way pot and the button overbets on King-8-4, the short stack's presence "protects" the aggressor. You can profitably call and jam over any third player shove. The bettor can overbet-bluff more liberally because he looks committed. In spots where a short stack's presence protects the aggressor, you can defend wider with hands that don't mind getting in—but tighten your folding range for marginal made hands that have to fold to additional pressure.

### Turn and River Warfare

The turn after a flop check-back is one of poker's most misplayed streets, and rivers become psychological battlegrounds where bet sizing tells complete stories.

**The probe bet after weakness:** Most players only continuation-bet when they connect with the board, checking back everything else. This creates predictably weak check-back ranges. On boards like Jack-Ten-7 rainbow where opponents should bet their entire range but instead check back high cards, weak pairs, and backdoor draws, fire aggressive turn probes (around 70% pot). You're not just bluffing—you're making them fold legitimate equity like ace-high and small pocket pairs that they weakly checked behind.

**Turn leads after flop check-backs:** When the preflop aggressor checks back a favorable flop, they've capped their range. On Jack-9-6 with a flush draw after the preflop three-bettor checks back, leading the turn is often superior to checking. They'll check back Ace-Queen, Ace-King, Ace-Jack frequently. You want value from these hands before scary rivers. They're unlikely to turn middle pair into a bluff. If they do bluff, it's likely a delayed river bluff you can exploit. Don't give free cards hoping to check-raise—most players won't cooperate.

**The delayed river bet:** With a marginal bluffing hand on a dynamic board, you only have one profitable barrel in you. The question is: which street generates maximum fold equity? River bets work better because you can size bigger (70% pot) while turn bets look suspicious going large, opponent has checked twice fully defining their range as weak, you allow them to catch up and bluff the turn themselves, and if they catch a pair on the turn, you get value from that new pair on the river.

**Reading bet sizing to determine blocker value:** Standard blocker theory breaks down when bet sizing reveals range composition. When someone bets half pot on a three-flush board, they're rarely representing the flush—that sizing screams straight or two-pair. Suddenly your queen-high flush blocker isn't good; it blocks their bluffing hands (missed straight draws with that suit), not their value. You'd rather hold the queen of a different suit to unblock bluffs. Before making river decisions, ask: "What hands would use THIS size?" Recalculate your blockers accordingly.

**Small leads for information:** Against recreational players when you have marginal showdown value and suspect they might barrel large otherwise, tiny "blocker bets" on the turn (1-2bb) can slow down action and potentially see a free river. This is exploitative and works specifically against passive opponents who aren't aggressive and might bet large with marginal hands if you check. Against thinking players, it just looks weak and invites raises. Use sparingly.

### ICM Exploitation and Final Table Dynamics

When you reach final tables—especially deep runs in major events—your preparation and mental approach become as crucial as your technical skills.

**Pre-day preparation transforms nerves into edges.** The night before Day 3, spend an hour systematically analyzing what you're walking into. Document every player's stack in chips and big blinds. Write strategic intentions: "I will play tight for 30 minutes because three players have under 10BB." Profile every opponent—how they see you, how you see them, specific hands they've shown, adjustments to make. Prepare practical scenarios with solvers for the actual spots you'll face, not random theory. This pre-commitment keeps you rational when anxiety spikes.

**Gamble hard early, not late.** Most players approach final tables backwards, thinking "I've locked up \$54K, let me not blow it." This is exactly wrong. The difference between 9th and 8th isn't life-changing. The difference between 9th and 3rd absolutely is. With 9 big blinds, you lose 2.6M every orbit at 700K/1.4M blinds. Go two orbits without winning and you're down to 6M. But double up immediately to 20M, then again to 40M, and you're top three in chips. Everyone else plays scared at televised final tables, watching pay jumps, feeling pressure. This universal tightness is your opportunity—raise relentlessly, three-bet liberally, and accumulate chips while they ladder.

**The forward shove with ICM leverage:** One of the most powerful—and least understood—final table weapons. The setup: Button (big stack) opens wide, small blind (second biggest) three-bets aggressively, you're in the big blind with a short-to-medium stack, massive dead money in the pot. The small blind is polarized—he has premiums (jacks+, Ace-King) and pure bluffs (Ace-5 suited, King-7 suited, suited connectors). Neither player wants to get all-in against each other due to ICM. When you forward-shove, you're almost never getting called. You're picking up 15+ big blinds without showdown 75-80% of the time.

The crucial insight: hands like Ace-5 suited massively outperform pocket nines here. Ace-5 suited blocks Ace-Ace and Ace-King (the hands that call you), and when you do get called by jacks/queens/kings, your Ace-5 suited has 35-40% equity. Pocket nines don't block premium pairs and have similar equity when called. Ace-5 suited performs better on final boards, making straights when overcards hit. You can forward-shove wider than most players think—sometimes 40-50% of hands when stack sizes align perfectly and the three-bettor is very aggressive.

**Seat selection on GG:** GG Poker lets you choose your seat at final tables. As a short stack, prioritize the cutoff seat—most players gravitate toward the button, making cutoff a "safe" exploitative choice. You avoid the chip leader's direct aggression while maintaining positional leverage. When you're the big stack, you want direct position on other large stacks to maximize your ability to apply pressure.

**The big stack playbook:** When you're chip leader at a final table, you're not just playing poker—you're playing everyone else's fear. Open absurdly wide from late position—against 35BB stacks in the blinds, raise hijack with King-7 offsuit, Queen-8 offsuit, Jack-9 offsuit, and virtually any suited cards. This isn't reckless; it's mathematically sound. Short-stacked blinds must defend extremely wide to avoid being exploited, but they can't profitably continue with many hands postflop. Use 3x raises instead of min-raises when short stacks are in the blinds—you're already priced in against their shoves, so make it harder for the big blind to profitably defend marginal hands.

**Image protection at final tables:** Fold marginal hands from early position even when they're theoretically profitable opens. Ace-3 offsuit from UTG with 35BB is a money-losing fold in a vacuum, but it's +EV tournament decision because opening creates collision effects with big stacks behind who will attack each other if you fold. Getting caught showing down weak holdings encourages opponents to reshove wider against your future button raises. This is especially true against skilled opponents from training sites who catalog your tendencies and exploit them precisely.

### Deep-Stacked Play Adjustments

When stacks reach 150+ big blinds, your entire approach must shift. Deep play isn't about making bigger bets—it's about controlling pot sizes early and exploiting opponents who misunderstand how ranges shift at extreme depths.

**Quarter-pot c-betting at extreme depths:** When 150bb deep, use quarter-pot c-bets relentlessly on disconnected boards. Your opponent can't have offsuit combos in their defending range—only pocket pairs and suited aces. A tiny bet folds out half their range while risking minimal chips. You're not trying to build a pot with air—you're making them pay the minimum to realize their equity against your entire range.

**Blockers matter more than actual hands:** With Ace-5 suited on King-9-6, you *don't* block Queen-Jack, Ten-8, or other natural floats—check. With Ace-Ten suited, you block many of those continuing hands—bet small. This counterintuitive adjustment (betting weaker aces and checking stronger ones) is what separates deep play from standard depths.

**Check-raising for pot control:** When you defend big blind with Ten-8 suited and flop middle pair on King-Ten-6, standard play says call the c-bet. Better play is check-raise small—not to build a pot, but to define one. By min-raising to 600 into 1,000, you're controlling the turn and river pot sizes out of position. Your opponent must tell you if they have a real hand now, not after calling flop and turn. Use this with middle pairs with backdoor equity, weak top pairs, and gutshots with overcards. Not strong top pair—that wants to trap and let them barrel.

**Against over-bluffers:** Don't start calling down lighter when you identify an over-bluffer. Instead, defend wider preflop and realize your equity better postflop. Call their preflop raises with Jack-7 suited instead of folding. When you flop a pair, you can call down profitably because they're bombing with air too often. At deep stacks against these players, call preflop raises with hands like Queen-9 offsuit from the small blind—pot odds are close, they're opening too wide, and at 130bb depth you'll get paid handsomely when you flop top pair.

### Heads-Up Precision

Heads-up play isn't about maximum aggression—it's about systematic exploitation based on which showdown values matter and how blockers interact with aggressive ranges.

**Start with 100% button aggression:** Raise every button (or limp to trap) until your opponent proves they'll punish you. Most players defend far too tight heads-up, especially in ICM spots. Watch their limp-calling range—when opponents limp-call, they're often playing fit-or-fold. This makes small flop c-bets with any two cards profitable and enables big river overbets when they show weakness.

**Three-bet shoving becomes hyper-precise:** Only reshove hands that either get better to fold (King-6 offsuit gets King-Queen to fold) or worse to call (King-6 offsuit gets Queen-5 to call). King-Jack offsuit is a pure call because it achieves neither objective—it's dominated by better kings/aces and dominates worse kings that would fold anyway. Against a 20BB open, hands like Queen-6 suited, Queen-5 suited, King-6 offsuit, King-5 offsuit, 65 suited become your reshoves—not hands like King-Jack offsuit that perform better as calls.

**Check-raise sizing contracts:** Use smaller check-raises on dry boards because you're targeting the massive number of offsuits (King-6 offsuit, Queen-8 offsuit) rather than backdoor draws. Hands gain showdown value—Queen-6 offsuit is legitimate and plays well. Don't inflate pots unnecessarily with these medium-strength holdings.

**Don't deal when you're superior:** If you've studied blind-versus-blind and wide-range spots extensively, playing it out has higher EV than chopping. Your edge compounds over many hands. New players either play too wild or too tight (treating heads-up like nine-handed). The answer is controlled aggression based on opponent response.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: The Seven-Four Suited Dilemma

You have 2.5bb in the small blind, big blind has 4bb, button has 14bb, four-handed. You have seven-four suited.

**Instinct:** Shove and hope to get through or flip.

**The analysis:** You have zero fold equity (both players getting great odds). When called, you're dominated by any better seven, any pair, any ace. There's a collision effect—sometimes the other short stack busts. No antes in the pot to steal.

**Correct play:** Fold and wait for the big blind, where you'll have antes to steal and actual fold equity. Seven-four suited plays terribly in a spot with no fold equity. You'd rather have King-5 offsuit (flops more pairs and doesn't get dominated as often).

### Example 2: The Pocket Nines ICM Trap

Button opens with 25bb stack, middle position calls, you're cutoff with 88 and 17bb.

**Standard thinking:** "I need to reshove to isolate."

**The problem:** When you reshove 17bb, what are they calling with? UTG has 99+, Ace-Queen suited+, Ace-King. MP has similar. You're almost always racing or crushed. That's not profitable.

**Better approach:** Flat call. Your range looks extremely strong (Ace-Ace, King-King, Ace-Jack suited+, tens+). This allows the big blind to come along with dominated hands like Queen-Jack offsuit that your range crushes in position. Only reshove 77+, Ace-Jack suited+, Ace-Queen offsuit+ against realistic calling ranges.

**Results:** In HRC, reshoving 88 here is -EV. Flatting is +EV. Yet most players instinctively reshove "because it's a pair."

### Example 3: The Forward Shove Masterclass

Final table with 26M chips (blinds 700K/1.4M). Button opens to 2.1M with a 50% opening range. Small blind three-bets to 7M—very aggressive player with polarized range.

If you forward-shove any ace here, you're picking up 15M without showdown most of the time. The small blind can't call with his bluffs (Ace-5 suited, King-7 suited), and even if he has a genuine hand like pocket jacks or Ace-Queen, you're not that far behind. The button almost never has a calling hand given his wide opening range and ICM concerns.

This single move takes you from 26M to 41M—from short stack to serious contender—without seeing a flop.

### Example 4: The Dynamic Turn Decision

You check-raise six-four offsuit on King-6-4 and get called. Turn brings a queen that creates double flush draws. 

**The lazy play:** Shove for "protection."

**The sophisticated play:** Bet 50% pot. You're not protecting against a king—if he has it, you're dead anyway. What you're doing is keeping in worse flush draws (jack-x clubs, ten-x clubs), allowing him to float with ace-high again, and setting up a river shove that folds out more equity. Your jam makes his decisions easy and binary. Your small bet makes them hard and gives him two chances to make mistakes.

### Example 5: The Quarter-Pot Bluff Deep

150bb deep, you open Ace-5 of clubs from the cutoff, big blind calls. Flop King-9-6 with hearts. You bet 250 into 1,000 (25% pot).

Your opponent has 88, 77 (no heart), Ace-7 suited (no heart), Ace-5 suited (no heart), and suited connectors with hearts. That tiny bet folds 88, 77, and many offsuit aces that don't have hearts anyway. You're risking a quarter pot to win the whole thing nearly half the time.

When called, you're not in disaster—you have nut flush draw outs and can continue bluffing when a club comes. The small size keeps your losses minimal when you're beat.

### Example 6: The River Blocker Trap

You call a flop and turn bet holding Queen-6 offsuit. The river completes obvious draws, and opponent shoves.

**You should call because:** You unblock all backdoor flush draws (no diamond, no spade), you don't interact with value hands (you're losing anyway), and the opponent constructs bluffs from missed draws, not from hands like yours.

**If you held Queen-Ten with a spade:** You'd fold—you block too many bluffs while not blocking any value. Context transforms blockers from good to bad instantly.

## Implementation Checklist

**Pre-Session Preparation:**
- Download ICMIZER or HRC and study your most common stack depths
- Pre-study three scenarios: 15bb reshove ranges, 12bb open-shove ranges, 20bb BB defense vs 12bb shove
- Note which suited broadways you're currently folding that should be shoves
- Set mental triggers: "Multi-way pot = consider micro-bet"
- Review stack depths across entire table before acting, not just your own
- Adjust bet slider with 10BB option to prime larger sizing against weak opponents

**Preflop Adjustments:**
- Expand small blind raising range in PSGO with hands like seven-three suited that don't play well as limp-calls
- Squeeze aggressively when short stacks are involved—most players won't, creating massive fold equity
- Against big blind three-bets, flat more in position instead of four-betting or folding
- Open 40%+ from hijack/cutoff when 35BB+ chip leader at final tables
- Stop flatting pocket tens/nines in squeeze spots (30BB effective)
- 3-bet kings+ only for value on button vs UTG in ICM situations
- Use 3x raise sizing vs short stacks (not min-raises)

**Flop Strategy:**
- On disconnected boards (king-two-three), range bet small (25-33%)
- On connected boards with flush draws, use two sizes: half-pot to fold out king-queen, pot to fold out ace-x
- Check-raise more in big blind defense, choosing hands with good blockers (blocking suited two-pairs, unblocking high cards)
- In multi-way pots, use 10-20% pot bets with hands needing protection
- Check entire range in big blind when covered; lead frequently when YOU cover preflop raiser

**Turn Play:**
- When preflop aggressor checks back, lead more for value—don't wait for scary rivers
- On dynamic turns, resist shove-for-protection urge; bet smaller to allow mistakes on two streets
- After checking back in position with medium strength, consider min-betting turn to control pot size
- Use 30-35% pot after large flop bet to fold out marginal equity while setting up three-street value
- Fire aggressive probes (70% pot) after opponent checks back flop with weak range

**River Decisions:**
- On three-flush boards after bluffing two streets, give up more—you've already folded out what you beat
- When you have nuts on dynamic boards, bet smaller; villain's range is capped and you want calls
- Think about opponent's bluffs—if few or nonexistent, bluff-catch wider
- After checking turn with marginal made hands, use delayed river bets for maximum fold equity
- Read bet sizing to determine blocker value: half-pot on three-flush rarely means flush

**Final Table Execution:**
- Choose your seat with intention on GG Poker
- Recognize when you're in extreme ICM spots and play tighter from early position
- Gamble hard early rather than laddering
- Identify ICM leverage spots (big stack vs big stack with you as squeezer)
- Forward-shove suited aces > pocket pairs when exploiting polarized three-bets
- Maintain high standards even after 10+ hours—fatigue causes sizing and hand selection leaks

**Mental Models:**
- Stop thinking "what's the GTO play?"—start thinking "what am I trying to make fold?"
- In PSGO, asking "how does the bounty change this?" should be automatic
- Against regulars, consider: "Is this a spot where population underbluffs?" If yes, exploit it
- Before every bet: "Will this size force the mistakes I want?"
- Work backward on rivers: "What hands use THIS bet size?" Then recalculate blockers
- Think in ranges against good players, hands against weak players
- Every post-flop decision: "What portion of their range am I targeting?"

**Advanced Study Priorities:**
- Spend 70% of study time on 8-30bb spots if playing primarily GG/fast structures
- Practice describing entire betting ranges out loud: "I'm betting 70% pot with vulnerable pairs, strong draws, and top pairs"
- When reviewing hands, always ask: "What is my opponent's range doing here?" before deciding
- Study how elite players adjust sizing based on opponent range strength, not just their own hand
- Build "button vs blinds" shoving/calling matrices for 12-20bb effective
- Review one tournament where you made final tables and identify missed range-bet spots

The ultimate insight: Tournament poker isn't about making hero calls on the river with third pair. It's about knowing that Ace-7 offsuit is correct against a 17bb shove when everyone else folds it, understanding that suited aces outperform pocket pairs in forward-shove spots, recognizing when quarter-pot bets accomplish everything that pot-sized bets do, and having the discipline to grind your comfort stakes for months after a breakthrough score. Master precision and patience, and the results follow.

# Chapter 7: Heads Up Play with Kevin Rabichow

## Overview

Heads-up play represents the single largest prize jump in tournament poker—yet it's the format most players study least. When you reach the final duel, effective stacks, opponent tendencies, and aggressive dynamics matter far more than memorized charts. This chapter reveals how to exploit the massive edges available when you understand proper heads-up strategy and your opponent doesn't.

The fundamental shift: heads-up poker isn't just poker with fewer players—it's a completely different game. Your ranges expand to include 80% of all hands. King-high becomes a legitimate bluff-catcher. Limping transforms from a leak into strategic weaponry. The players who master these adjustments dominate final tables; those who don't hemorrhage chips trying to apply full-ring logic to two-player dynamics.

Before engaging in any heads-up battle, ask yourself: Would you willingly sit this opponent in a heads-up sit-and-go for the amount you're effectively playing for? If you're battling for a \$50,000 pay jump at 60 big blinds effective, that's essentially a \$25,000 heads-up match. If your answer is no, your ego—not the math—is making the decision. Sometimes the correct play is dealing.

## Core Principles

**Stack depth dictates your strategic framework**

The critical insight in heads-up play is that as stacks get shallower, your opening raise frequency *decreases* while your overall VPIP stays high through increased limping. At 50 big blinds, you're raising 62% of hands. At 40 big blinds, you drop to 48%. At 20 big blinds, just 25%. At 15 big blinds, only 11%. By 10 big blinds, you raise 0%—only shoving or limping.

Why? Because as effective stacks decrease, your opponent gets better risk-reward ratios for jamming over your opens. You must shift more hands into limping ranges to avoid constantly facing all-in decisions with medium-strength holdings. This isn't weakness—it's mathematical precision.

**Range width transforms everything**

Both you and your opponent are playing drastically wider ranges than in any other format. When you're defending with Seven-Six offsuit and raising with Ten-Five, you're not being loose—you're being correct. This fundamentally changes blocker logic: instead of blocking the top of someone's range (which matters in full-ring where ranges are condensed), you want to unblock their weak holdings and bluffs.

On a Jack-Seven-Seven board, your opponent's big blind defense includes hands like Five-Two offsuit, Queen-Three offsuit, and countless other combinations that barely interact with the board. This creates profit opportunities through aggressive betting that would be reckless at a full table but are mandatory heads-up.

**Build ranges in layers, not by memorization**

Instead of memorizing which exact hands to play at each stack depth, construct your ranges using a logical hierarchy:

1. **Pure folds** - The bottom 5% trash (72o, 83o, etc.)
2. **Pure limps** - Defensive hands that don't want to face aggression (T2s, J2s, Q2s, weak suited connectors)
3. **Pure raise-folds** - Blockers with poor playability (K2o-K4o, Q2o-Q4o, J2o-J6o, 72s-92s)
4. **Mixed frequency hands** - Everything between your strongest and weakest holdings (mix 50/50 between raising and limping)
5. **Pure raises (value)** - Premium hands and strong suited holdings (broadways, suited aces, high pairs)

This framework adapts naturally as stacks change—you simply expand the limp layer and contract the raise layer as you get shallower.

**Out-of-position aggression is extremely powerful**

The big blind has enormous leverage through strategic re-jamming. Most opponents drastically overfold to shoves, creating massive exploitative opportunities. Population tendencies show players folding hands like QTs, Q9s, JTs when they should be calling. If someone raises frequently without limping, you can profitably jam almost any two cards.

**Position value decreases as stacks shrink**

Deep-stacked, being in position lets you maneuver across multiple streets. But at 15 big blinds, most pots resolve preflop or on the flop. This means your hand's raw equity and blockers matter more than your positional advantage. Don't sacrifice immediate EV trying to "outplay" opponents postflop when the mathematics favor straightforward aggression.

**Your edge lives in wide-range situations**

Players comfortable with 28% VPIP in full-ring tournaments suddenly face 80%+ VPIP requirements heads-up. They struggle. They know when to fold 72o, but do they know how to defend Q5o? Can they barrel turns with second pair? Do they check-raise flops at the right frequency?

The profit isn't in hero calls for stacks—it's in repeatedly exploiting opponents in small to medium pots where they overfold, undercall, or play passively. This creates low-variance, high-frequency edges that compound over time.

## Key Strategies

### Deep Stack Play (40-50bb)

**Your opening strategy:**

When 50bb deep, raise 62% of hands, limp 31%, fold just 5%. Your pure raise range includes all suited broadways, suited aces, suited kings, pocket pairs, and hands like T9s, J9s, T8s. Use the "raise-fold bluff" layer: hands like 72s, 82s, 92s, K3o, Q5o, J6o—hands that benefit from folding out equity but play terribly when called.

Mix 50/50 with everything in between. For example, J8o, J9o, T5s—sometimes raise, sometimes limp. Don't try to randomize in real-time. Instead, always raise one combo (like KTs) and always limp another (like K9s). The frequencies even out across your range without requiring mental gymnastics.

Start with a pure raise-only approach until you gather information about your opponent. Most tournament players won't attack your raises aggressively enough, so this prints money immediately. Once your opponent starts three-betting frequently (more than theoretical 22-24%), introduce limping.

**When facing a 3-bet:**

At 50bb, the big blind has no jamming range—only min-3bets. Their 3-betting frequency sits around 25%, composed of strong suited broadways, pairs 6+, and critically, suited bluff combos like 64s, 75s, K2s, Q2s.

Key insight: Deep stacked, their bluffs are *suited* hands because they need playability if called. This is the opposite of shallow play.

Against their 3-bet, you fold all the offsuit junk (you were raise-folding anyway), call with strong high-card hands (KJo+, T9s+, pocket pairs), and 4-bet shove with 8s-Js (for value) and A5o, A4o, AQo (polarized).

**Common mistake:** Don't 4-bet shove high pocket pairs (QQ+) at this depth. You want to slow-play them because your opponent's range is capped—they don't have the strongest hands in their 3-betting range. When you have AA or KK, you print more EV by flatting and letting them continue bluffing.

**Against limps:**

When facing limps at 40bb+, iso-raise extremely wide—any suited hand, any reasonable equity. People limp weak ranges, then play passively postflop. Focus on suited hands over offsuit. 65s is a powerhouse against a limp-call range, while J5o just makes dominated pairs.

If your opponent limps for the first time after raising many hands in a row, isolate 100% of the time. This is almost always weakness—they're either trying to get tricky or have a marginal hand they don't want to face aggression with. Punish it immediately.

**Big blind aggression:**

Here's a counterintuitive truth: At 40bb, if your opponent plays raise-only and you haven't seen them limp, you can likely shove any two cards profitably as a three-bet.

Most players call too tight when you jam. They think "40bb is deep, I need a strong hand." They fold Q8o, J9s, small pairs—exactly the hands that should continue. Even if they call "wide" with ATo+, KQo+, 55+, and A8s+, you're printing money by jamming low suited cards (85s, 74s, 63s), dominated offsuit kings and queens (K6o, Q6o), suited gap hands (95s, 84s), and low suited aces.

These hands perform poorly in called pots but have enough equity when called, and your fold equity is massive. You're not just winning the immediate pot—you're forcing a strategic shift. If you jam enough, your opponent faces a choice: start limping (giving you a better game) or keep raising and bleeding chips.

### Mid-Stack Play (25-30bb)

**Critical adjustment: The offsuit ace shove zone**

At these depths, your jamming range over opponent opens becomes predominantly offsuit aces and pocket pairs. Hands like A2o-ATo are your bread and butter shoves because they:
- Fold out dominated holdings
- Perform well when called (usually flipping or slightly ahead)
- Unblock hands your opponent continues with

You're also jamming hands with pure equity: 22-77 (to deny equity and win immediately), strong suited connectors like 87s, 98s.

**3-bet bluffs shift to offsuit:**

Deep, you 3-bet bluff with suited hands. At 25-30bb, your 3-bet bluffs become *offsuit* hands: K2o-K4o, Q2o-Q4o, J2o-J6o. Why? Because these hands have poor playability if called, block premium holdings, and you're not building a postflop 3-bet pot—you're usually going all-in anyway.

**Your raising range structure:**

Three distinct blocks emerge:
1. **Block 1 (Strong):** Premium pairs and big aces you're happy to call a shove with
2. **Block 2 (Medium):** Hands like Nines, Eights, Sevens, Ace-Nine offsuit—inducing value hands that need protection
3. **Block 3 (Polar bluffs):** Suited connectors and weak suited hands you'll fold to a shove

Everything else limps. Especially Broadway hands like Ace-Queen offsuit, Ace-Jack offsuit, King-Queen offsuit. These look like raising hands, but they're pure limps now. Why? You want every hand that's truly happy to raise-call (suited aces, premium pairs) to actually raise, maximizing EV when opponents overshove.

**Key insight on suited aces:** Ace-Ten through Ace-Queen suited should be raised at high frequency (unlike the solver's mixing strategy) because your opponents will shove too much. You block their aces, so when they do shove, they're doing it with worse hands.

**Facing aggression:**

When you raise and face a jam at 25-30bb, you must call wider than feels comfortable. If you raise and get jammed on, you're folding hands like Q8o, J7o, but calling any pocket pair you opened, any suited high card (T9s+, J9s+), and all your offsuit broadway (KJo+).

The math is clear: you're getting great pot odds, and your opponent is shoving wide to prevent you from stealing. Don't overfold.

### Shallow Stack Play (15-20bb)

**Raise frequency collapses:**

At 20bb, you raise just 25% of hands. At 15bb, only 11%. The rest of your range limps.

Your pure raising range contracts to the absolute premium: AA-JJ, AKs-AJs, AKo-AQo, plus your raise-fold layer (same blockers: K2o-K4o, Q2o-Q4o, 72s-92s).

Everything else either shoves or limps. Hands like KQs, KJs, QJs—formerly easy raises—now prefer to limp because they hate facing jams but aren't strong enough to induce (like you would with AA or KK).

**Big blind jamming ranges explode:**

At 20bb, the big blind jams 30% against your opens. At 15bb, even more. They're shoving 22-QQ (only slow-playing KK+), all offsuit aces, all suited aces, plus KQo, KJo, and equity hands like 65s.

**Your response:** Call wider than you think. Hands like 87s, T9s, J9s are mandatory calls. You're folding only true trash and the weakest offsuit hands. Queen-high offsuit (Q9o-QJo) becomes your folding threshold.

**The critical mistake most players make:**

Players limp-fold way too much at 15bb. You should be limp-calling around 24% of the time (folding only 76%). Most players fold 85%+, allowing opponents to print money with any-two-card shoves.

Hands you MUST limp-call:
- Nine-Eight suited, Eight-Seven suited, Seven-Six suited
- Queen-Ten suited, King-Six suited
- Pocket pairs (all of them)

Why these hands play so well: When your opponent shoves over your limp, their range includes lots of non-all-in ISO hands. They're not shoving pocket nines+; those go into their raise-call range. You're flipping or slightly ahead against their trashy offsuit broadway hands, and you're getting great pot odds.

**Common population mistake:** Players fold way too tight here. If you notice your opponent raising frequently without limping at 15-20bb, start jamming any two cards. Seriously. Run the calculation—if they're raising 40%+ and folding to jams even close to GTO frequencies, you can jam literally any holding profitably. This is the single biggest exploitable leak in population heads-up play.

**Big blind aggression at 15 big blinds:**

Non-all-in ISOs are crucial from the big blind. Look at the solver: almost every offsuit hand is mixing in some raising frequency. Even King-Eight offsuit, Queen-Eight offsuit, and Jack-Eight offsuit are considering raises.

Why this matters:
1. If you're too passive, you let the button limp-realize equity with their entire range
2. Your checking range becomes too weak and gets demolished postflop by relentless aggression
3. You need to remove trash from your checking range by ISOing aggressively

The ace-versus-king phenomenon: King-X suited hands (King-Queen, King-Jack, King-Ten) ISO aggressively at 15bb, while Ace-X suited hands prefer shoving. Why? Post-flop domination. In limp-call pots, King-X suited actually dominates the limp-calling range (which includes weaker kings and queens). Ace-X doesn't get this benefit because aces either open-shove or limp-shove—they're never in limp-call pots.

### Ultra-Shallow (10bb)

**No more raises—only shove or limp:**

At 10bb effective, you have zero non-all-in raising range. You either shove or limp. This is elegant in its simplicity.

**Shoving range:** All offsuit aces (A2o-ATo), all offsuit kings (K2o-KTo), pocket pairs 22-TT, plus some strong suited hands that don't want to play postflop (but not the best ones—those limp to induce). Use Nash charts as reference—shove any hand that's profitable as a jam.

**Limping range:** Speculative hands that play well but aren't strong enough to limp-call all-in. Hands like 54s, 65s, 75s want to see flops cheaply. Your premium hands (JJ+, AJs+, AQo+) also limp to trap. Additionally, limp hands like 66-77 instead of shoving them—they become limp-calls to trap overcards.

**Against big blind aggression:** Call any ace, any king, any pair, any strong suited hand when facing a jam. You're getting enormous pot odds and your opponent is shoving 40%+ of hands. Fold only weak offsuit holdings (J8o and worse).

**Against limps:** You should be shoving approximately 50% of hands from the big blind. Your shoving range: any Ace, any King, Q4s+, Q8o+, all pairs, suited connectors 76s+, suited one-gappers 86s+, and some suited trash with blockers.

### The 30-40BB Transition Zone

This is where strategies diverge sharply from deeper play. At 40bb, people start finding shoves, but not the right ones. They shove AJs and pocket pairs, but not Q6s or K5o. This creates specific exploits.

**Button strategy evolution:**

Continue raising 2.2x rather than min-raising. Yes, you face more aggression, but you're also charging equity against opponents who defend too wide. When someone flats 55-60% against your raise, making them play bigger pots with dominated hands is profitable.

Your limp frequency should increase here, but maintain aggression in your limps. Mix in limp-three-bets with:
- Value: 66+, AJo+, suited broadway
- Bluffs: Offsuit blockers just below limp-call threshold (Q5o, J7o, T6o)

This traps opponents who iso-raise too linearly and creates massive pots when you're ahead.

**The small limp re-raise:**

When facing a polarized ISO strategy (strong hands + trash), try min-raising their ISO with your weakest continuing hands. If they ISO to 3.5bb, make it 8bb total. Their trashy 30% of ISO hands can't continue, and when they do have the top of their range, you're not losing much EV compared to calling since they would have gotten it in anyway.

This works because:
- They fold their bluffs at high frequency
- You're not changing your shoving range (still jamming Ace-Ten+)
- You're just adding a new line for borderline hands like Ten-Seven offsuit

### Postflop Play: Deep Stack Dynamics

**Dynamic bet sizing based on range interaction:**

On dry, paired boards when you're in position against a wide defending range, start with 25-33% pot bets. On a J♥7♣7♦ board, bet 25% pot on the flop to make opponent's Q-2 offsuit, 5-3 suited, and similar trash incorrect to continue. When the turn brings a J♣, you're using pot-sized bets to polarize around flushes and better.

This isn't a range bet—you're checking plenty of marginal hands like J-9 or gutshots that don't mind giving up immediately. You're milking weak ranges cheaply, then detonating when the board changes.

**Common mistake:** Using "standard" 50-66% bets regardless of board texture. This either gives correct odds to trash hands that should fold, or fails to build pots with your value hands when opponent's range is capped and weak.

**The small check-raise revolution:**

When facing a large (75%+ pot) continuation bet in position at deep stacks, most players either call or fold. But there's a third option that's brutally effective: the small check-raise to 2.2x their bet.

Why it works: Big bettors are polarized. They're betting strong hands and bluffs, but not much in between. When you have a marginal hand like middle pair or a weak top pair, you don't want to call and face more pressure. But a small raise to 6-7bb when the pot is already large forces them to continue with a tighter range.

Your opponent has tons of hands like Q-J offsuit, K-6 suited, or gutshots with backdoor equity. These hands opened from the button at 100bb deep because that's correct, but they can't continue versus any aggression on a board like 8-5-2.

**Turn leading from big blind:**

After checking the flop out of position, leading the turn with medium-strength made hands, draws without showdown value, and some Seven-x that didn't check-raise the flop creates enormous value.

On that J♣7♣7♥ → J♣ runout, lead your weak Ace-x (blocking strong aces that would have bet), your Jack-x that doesn't have a premium kicker, your Seven-x that took a passive line, and all your flush draws with zero showdown value. Use 40-50% pot sizing.

Why this works: Your opponent checked back so many weak hands on the flop. By leading, you're targeting all those Q-10, K-9, A-5 type hands that correctly bet the flop but can't continue on this turn. You're putting pressure on a range that's mostly weak high cards and backdoor equity.

**River bet sizing in position:**

Avoid small river bets in position unless both players have extremely connected ranges. If the pot is 10bb and you bet 3bb with middle pair, you need to be good 60%+ of the time when called—already a thin margin. But you've also reopened the action, and suddenly you're making close to zero EV or losing money on a hand that would've checked down profitably.

Better approach: Use 50%, 100%, 175%, and all-in as your four sizes. If your hand isn't worth a half-pot bet, it's usually better to check and either win at showdown or bluff-catch. After checking back the turn with your medium-strength hands and betting with your strong ones, the river arrives. Now you're either checking your medium pairs (which are too weak to bet but ahead of bluffs) or betting large with your value hands and bluffs.

**Defending vs. tiny donk bets:**

You'll frequently face 10-15% pot donk leads from the big blind, especially when draw-heavy turns complete. Against a 10% pot bet, you need roughly 5% equity to call profitably. With any two live cards against a range that includes weak pairs and complete air, you're easily clearing this threshold.

The psychology trap: Players analyze their hand against the opponent's best possible holding instead of against their range. On a board like Q-4-4-T, your K-8 has two live overcards and immediately beats all their ace-highs. That's an auto-call.

### Advanced Concepts: Blocking Effects and Strategic Timing

**Low card advantages:**

When considering a multi-street bluff, think about which cards block your opponent's continuing range. With a hand like 5-4 offsuit on a Q-9-8 board, your low cards actually provide useful information.

In preflop ranges, suited and connected cards exist, but offsuit trash doesn't. Your opponent can have Q-4 offsuit or Q-3 offsuit, but they can't have 9-4 offsuit or 8-4 offsuit. Low cards in your hand statistically block top pair better than they block middle or bottom pair.

This means 5-4 can be a better barreling hand than A-2 on certain boards. You block fewer of the folds (small pairs that will occasionally fold) and more of the calls (top pair combinations).

**The 10-5 rule:** Every straight contains either a ten or a five. When you hold one of these cards, you're always blocking some portion of the straight combinations available. This makes hands like 10-5 offsuit surprisingly effective bluffing candidates on connected boards.

**Strategic check-raising with blockers:**

Use check-raises not just for value or as bluffs, but specifically because your exact hand blocks the value region your opponent is representing. When you checked the flop, opponent checked back, and you checked the turn facing a small bet on the river, this line from your opponent represents a very narrow, specific range—usually medium flushes or weak made hands trying to get thin value.

By holding Jack-x on a board where a second Jack arrived on the turn, you block the stronger flushes (which would have bet bigger or earlier) and fold out the medium ones. World-class players check-raise based on what their specific holding blocks in opponent's range for this exact betting line.

**Exploiting time pressure:**

When your opponent has no time bank, they can't properly calculate against unusual lines or sizing. This is when you use mixed strategies more liberally, employ unconventional sizings, take non-standard lines (like check-raising with air), and apply consistent pressure across streets.

Don't just blast aggression mindlessly. Create situations that require creative responses within short time windows. An overbet followed by a min-raise creates an entirely different decision tree than standard play. Your opponent must generate a novel response in seconds—most can't do it well.

### The Polarized 9x Reraise Strategy

This is the game-changer most players miss entirely. When your opponent limps, you face a choice: raise small to build the pot linearly, or raise huge to apply maximum pressure. The 9x reraise (raising a 1bb limp to 9bb total) is a polarized weapon that transforms heads-up dynamics.

Your 9x range includes:
- **Premium hands that lose value on later streets:** Jacks, ace-king, ace-queen—hands that are ahead now but don't want to see turns and rivers
- **Complete trash with no playability:** Seven-three suited, eight-two suited, queen-seven offsuit—hands that achieve nothing as check-backs post-flop

When you raise to 9x, you force folds from the entire middle of your opponent's limping range. All those king-seven offsuit, queen-nine offsuit, ten-five suited hands that comfortably call 4x? They fold to 9x. You eliminate exactly the hands that have decent equity against your bluffs while ensuring your value hands get action from aggressive shoves.

Opponents start shoving wider than they should—you'll see ace-jack, ace-ten, small pairs, even king-queen all-in against your 9x reraise because it's uncomfortable. This is exactly what you want with jacks, ace-queen, and tens. Compare this to small raises: a 4x reraise only folds the bottom trash that has terrible equity anyway.

## Practical Examples

**Example 1: Exploiting the non-limper at 40bb**

You're 40bb effective heads up. Your opponent has raised the button 4 out of the last 5 hands and hasn't limped once.

*Exploitation:* They're playing a raise-or-fold strategy, which is drastically exploitable. From the big blind, you can profitably jam any two cards. Run the simulation: if they're raising 75%+ and folding even remotely close to correct frequencies (calling ~14% against your jam), every single hand in your range profits from jamming.

Tactical implementation: Don't jam every hand immediately—this tips off your strategy. Instead, when they raise the next 2-3 hands, jam. Mix in some 3-bet bluffs with your weakest holdings (95o, J4o) to vary your approach.

**Example 2: The 25bb limp-shove trap**

You're 25bb effective and limp AA from the small blind. Big blind checks.

Flop comes K♠8♣3♥. You check, big blind bets 60% pot with T8o. You check-raise all-in.

*Why this works:* At shallow stacks, opponents assume limped ranges are capped. When you limp AA, KK, QQ (which you should at this depth), you can over-realize equity by allowing your opponent to bluff at you. Your limp-check-raise on safe boards is massively +EV because villain is value-betting and bluffing a huge range they can't defend with.

**Example 3: The offsuit ace shove at 30bb**

You're 30bb effective. Opponent raises button. You look down at A5o in the big blind.

*Correct play:* Jam. This feels exploitable—"what if they have AA or KK?"—but the math is clear. At 30bb, A5o shoves profitably against a wide opening range. You fold out dominated holdings (K8o, Q9o), flip against pairs below nines, and occasionally run into bigger aces or pairs—but you're still getting it in profitably overall.

**Example 4: Recognizing the 20bb 3-bet bluff layer**

You're 20bb deep and raise K9s from the button. Big blind 3-bets to 6bb (leaving 14bb behind).

Their 3-betting range here is polarized: premiums (TT+, AJs+) that want to get it in, and bluffs with blockers (K3o-K4o, Q3o-Q4o, J3o-J6o). These offsuit bluffs can't call your 4-bet shove.

*Correct adjustment:* You can 4-bet shove K9s profitably here. You fold out their entire bluffing range, flip against medium pairs, and occasionally run into better—but your fold equity makes this massively profitable.

**Example 5: The double delay bluff**

You hold 4-3 offsuit on a J-7-2 rainbow board. Action goes check-check on flop, check-check on a 9 turn, and a 5 blanks the river. You fire 70% pot and your opponent folds K-Q.

Why this works: The check-check-bet line appears extremely value heavy. Your opponent thinks you slow-played trips or two-pair. Meanwhile, you correctly identified that their range contains many king-high and queen-high hands that bet turn for value when checked to but give up when you show aggression.

**Example 6: The blocker check-raise**

You're in the big blind with J♠8♣ at 35 big blinds. You call a button raise.

Flop: J♥7♣7♦ (check-check)
Turn: J♣ (you lead 40% pot with your trips, opponent calls)
River: 8♦ (you check, opponent bets 33% pot)

This looks like a clear check-call spot—you have trips with an eight kicker. But the check-raise here is brilliant when you understand the theory.

What hands take opponent's exact line? They checked back the flop (eliminating most Jacks and Sevens). They called your turn lead (eliminating strong flushes that would raise). Now they're betting small on the river.

This line looks exactly like a weak flush or maybe a straight that's trying to get thin value. By check-raising with your Jack, you're blocking the combinations they'd check back (better Jacks), and you're forcing them to fold the medium flushes and straights that took this exact line.

**Example 7: Ace-high barrel opportunity**

You open from button with jack-four suited. Opponent calls. Flop comes A-8-3 rainbow.

You have a massive range advantage—your opponent would often shove or reraise preflop with ace-king, ace-queen, even ace-jack at shallow stacks. When they just call, their ace-x hands are weaker (ace-nine, ace-seven) and they have lots of king-jack, queen-jack type hands.

Bet small on the flop (0.33 pot). When called, continue barreling turns that don't complete draws—a five, a two, even a king. Your opponent has to fold most king-highs and is in rough shape with weak aces. On the river, bet polarized (large or check)—if you've been called twice, they likely have a weak ace they won't fold, so check-give up with air or bet large with value only.

## Implementation Checklist

**Immediate adjustments for your next heads-up match:**

- **Stop memorizing charts.** Build ranges using the five-layer system: pure folds, pure limps, raise-fold bluffs, mixed frequency, pure value raises.

- **Track opponent limping frequency.** If they raise more than 50% from 20bb+ without limping, prepare to jam exploitatively.

- **At 25bb+, shift 3-bet bluffs to offsuit high cards.** Use K2o-K4o, Q2o-Q4o, not suited hands.

- **At 15-20bb, widen your calling range against jams.** You should be calling any suited connector 87s+, any pocket pair, any offsuit broadway. If you're folding more than 70%, you're being exploited.

- **At 10bb, eliminate min-raises entirely.** Only shove or limp.

- **Limp your strongest hands at shallow stacks.** AA and KK print more EV limping at 15bb than raising because opponents blast off too light.

- **Against unknown opponents, start conservative with jamming frequencies.** Once you notice they're overfolding (folding hands like QTs, KJs to your jams), exponentially increase your jamping frequency.

- **Practice constructing ranges at each stack depth.** Before your next session, write out your 50bb, 30bb, 20bb, and 15bb ranges using the layer system.

**Next session goals:**

- **Test opponents at 40-50bb:** Raise your first 5-10 hands and track three-bet frequency. If they fold >80%, increase raising range. If they three-bet >20%, increase limping range.

- **Track limp isolation patterns:** When your opponent limps, note what hands they show up with. First-time limps are usually exploitable.

- **Identify shoving tendencies:** Note which hands opponents shove in isolation spots. Are they polarized correctly or over-shoving Broadway hands?

# Chapter 8: Off the Tables: Tools & Mindset

## Overview

Your poker career won't be built at the tables—it'll be built in the hours between sessions. The difference between a professional who maximizes their edge and someone who spins their wheels comes down to three interconnected elements: how they structure their time around high-value opportunities, how they study with precision using modern tools, and how they manage bankroll and variance intelligently. 

Most players focus exclusively on in-game decisions while neglecting the infrastructure that enables peak performance. They study randomly, play whenever they feel like it, and wonder why progress stalls. Meanwhile, professionals treat poker like elite athletes treat competition—the game itself is just the visible outcome of systematic preparation.

This chapter reveals the complete off-table system: building your week around maximum-EV days, using solvers and training tools to transform theoretical knowledge into instinctive decisions, protecting your bankroll through smart variance management, and optimizing your technical setup so focus stays on strategy rather than logistics.

## Core Principles

**The 10x Sunday Principle**

Here's the math that changes everything: A typical Monday session might generate \$200 in expected value. A Sunday session? Easily \$1,800—often more.

Why? Three factors compound:

- **Volume multiplies**: Monday offers 25 playable tournaments. Sunday offers 60-80 high-value tournaments with overlapping start times
- **Field size explodes**: The Big \$55 gets 200 runners on Monday, 600+ on Sunday. Prize pools triple or quintuple
- **Your edge increases**: Recreational players show up on Sundays. The \$215 that's reg-infested on Tuesday becomes soft on Sunday when amateurs fire bullets

Run the calculation yourself. Most professionals trace their biggest scores to either Sundays or series. If you miss Sundays, you're missing your career. This single insight restructures how you approach every day of the week.

**Energy is currency**

You can't grind 3pm to 4am on Sunday, make optimal decisions in a \$1,000 deep run, then expect to study effectively Monday morning. Energy management across seven days determines Sunday performance. Professionals treat Monday and Tuesday as recovery days—not because they're lazy, but because championship athletes don't sprint the day before the race.

**Understanding variance changes behavior**

Even as a solid 10% ROI player grinding 5,000 tournaments per year in 800-player fields, you'll have a losing year 20% of the time. Break it down further: you'll lose 43% of months, 54% of weeks, and 70% of individual sessions. This is with a genuine edge. Most of your profit comes from infrequent big scores, not consistent grinding.

If you can't handle this reality—if you need stable weekly income or can't explain another losing month to your family—you must either adjust expectations or change your game selection to smaller fields with lower variance.

**Software is a magnifying glass, not a crutch**

Solvers show you optimal strategies, but the real learning happens when you understand *why* certain plays work. You're not memorizing outputs—you're building intuition about board textures, stack depths, and range interactions. Population tendencies create massive exploits that pure GTO solutions miss. Real players overfold to aggression, miss thin value bets, and struggle with multistreet defense.

## Key Strategies

### Structure Your Weekly Cycle Around Sunday

**Monday-Tuesday: Recovery Phase**

Accept this reality: You won't want to study Monday. You just played 13 hours. You ran bad in spots worth thousands. You're mentally exhausted. Stop fighting it.

Instead, optimize recovery:

- Sleep properly—your body needs 8-9 hours after a Sunday marathon
- Fix your diet—you ate poorly while grinding, now eat well-balanced meals
- Exercise—walk, lift, spa, whatever resets your nervous system
- Process gratitude—watch your girlfriend take the bus to her job she dislikes at 8am while you have the freedom to play poker

The Monday urge to "grind back" losses is a trap. Even if you win, you're making \$200 EV. Even if you lose, you're burning energy you need for Wednesday's study session. The players who build long careers understand this.

**Wednesday-Saturday: Build Phase**

This is your work week. Every professional studies Wednesday through Saturday and plays lighter schedules on off-peak days if they play at all.

Your study priorities:

1. **Review Sunday's saved hands** (20-25 spots): Run solvers, post in study groups, discuss with your coach. Don't just scroll aimlessly—focus on spots where your intuition conflicted with your decision.

2. **Identify patterns**: Were you overfolding big blind vs small blind steals? Bluffing too wide on certain board textures? Use tools like CheckDecide to filter hand histories so you only review meaningful decisions—every blind defense, every strong hand you folded, every significant pot.

3. **Study when your energy peaks**: If you're sharp at 6am, study then. If you think clearly at midnight, study then. Don't mimic someone else's schedule.

4. **Use deliberate practice**: 15-30 minutes on training bots before each session builds more skill than grinding 1,000 hands on autopilot. Play specific scenarios repeatedly—"button opens 25bb effective, I'm in the big blind"—and verbalize your reasoning before deciding.

**Saturday Night: Launch Preparation**

Treat this like a pilot's pre-flight checklist:

- Sleep late (6-7am) so you're alert for Sunday's 3am final tables—your most +EV hours come when you're deep in big tournaments
- Restart your computer and router—no Windows updates mid-session
- Verify all subscriptions are active (table management software, HUDs, tracking software)
- Prep or order food in advance—no Uber Eats mid-grind
- Clear your calendar—no social obligations that could create resentment

Create a physical checklist and execute it religiously. F1 drivers check every system before the race. Surgeons run checklists before surgery. You should do the same before risking thousands of dollars.

**Sunday: Execution Day**

This is game day. Your only job is to play optimally for 8-13 hours. Save every marginal spot in your HUD as you play—every 3-bet call you're unsure about, every river bluff that felt thin, every ICM decision where you tangled. By Monday evening, you should have 20-25 hands queued for next week's study.

### Manage Variance and Bankroll Intelligently

**Align strategy with your life situation**

Before you worry about buy-in rules, answer one question: Why are you playing poker?

If you're grinding from \$0 to escape your day job, preservation matters more than growth. You need 200+ buy-ins for your regular stakes, immediate move-down triggers at 100 buy-ins, and high volume in smaller fields to smooth results. If you can grind 10,000 tournaments per year in 220-player fields instead of 5,000 tournaments in 800-player fields, you have essentially 0% chance of a losing year.

But if you already have income and you're shooting for a big score, you can embrace higher variance and take calculated shots. Keep your regular grind conservative, but use variance-control methods when taking shots at higher stakes.

**Understand field size's impact on variance**

Compare these scenarios for a 10% ROI player grinding 5,000 tournaments:

- **800-player fields**: 20% chance of losing year, 43% chance of losing month
- **220-player fields**: 5% chance of losing year, 36% chance of losing month

Smaller fields smooth your results dramatically. If you need stable income, playing higher volume in smaller fields beats chasing big scores in massive tournaments.

**Always be pessimistic about your win rate**

Poker players consistently overestimate their edge. If you think you have 20% ROI, assume 10%. Plan for the worst-case scenario, and anything better becomes a bonus.

### Selling Action: Your Secret Weapon

Selling action isn't just about reducing risk—it's about creating a consistent profit stream while building a network for future opportunities.

**The shot-taking framework**

If your comfortable ABI is \$50, the \$530 Bounty Builder on Sunday is mandatory—even though it's 10x your normal buy-in. Here's why:

- Your ROI in this soft Sunday field might be 40-50%
- The experience of playing higher stakes under real pressure is invaluable
- Selling 80% of your action turns it into a \$100 tournament for you—but with full experience value

**The markup model**

When you have legitimate edge, you can sell action at markup. If you're a 20% ROI player in \$500 tournaments, your expected value on each buy-in is \$600. You can sell action at 1.1 markup (\$550 per share), splitting the difference.

Real numbers: Say you play 200 tournaments per year at \$530 average buy-in and sell 50% at 1.1 markup. That's \$5,300 risk-free profit just from markup. As you build credibility and move up stakes, this scales dramatically—some high-roller players make \$400,000+ annually just from markup.

**How to sell effectively**

Start Monday or Tuesday, not Saturday:

- On GG Poker, list your Sunday package in the staking section a week early—even crushers with \$800K profit sell 55% of Sunday action
- Join staking Skype groups where players at all levels swap action
- Offer 1.05 markup if you're winning—fair compensation for your edge without being greedy
- Build credibility: post hands publicly, make strategy videos, stream occasionally

Better yet: Get staked by a stable for a higher ABI than you can currently afford. If a reputable stable offers to back you in \$250 ABI tournaments (5x your current level) with coaching included, that's probably +EV even at worse-than-standard terms.

**The compound effect**

If you sell 60% of your Sunday action at 1.05 markup every week:

- You reduce variance dramatically
- You lock in 5% pure profit on markup alone
- You maintain motivation (losing \$500 of someone else's money hurts less than losing \$500 of yours)
- You gain accountability—people investing in you creates positive pressure

### Protect Sunday From Social Interference

Most poker careers fail because of social friction, not poker inability. Your girlfriend resents Sunday grinds. Your friends stop inviting you out. Your family thinks you're wasting your life.

This happens when you don't communicate or compensate. Fix it Monday through Saturday:

- Check your calendar for birthdays, weddings, important dates—address them Friday or Monday, not Sunday
- Explain the math: Show your parents or partner the exact calculation of Monday EV (\$200) vs Sunday EV (\$1,800). Make them understand this isn't stubbornness; it's business
- Be fully present on Saturday—if your partner gets quality time when you're not distracted by poker, they'll support Sunday focus
- Involve them on Sunday: When family understands Sunday's importance, they become your pit crew—bringing food, staying quiet during key spots, celebrating wins

When loved ones understand and support your Sunday priority, they also support your Monday recovery. That support system is worth 5% ROI by itself.

### Optimize Your Technical Setup

**Table Management with Dirigent**

Your brain has limited processing power. When you're clicking and dragging tables during critical decisions, you're wasting mental energy. Dirigent (free) solves this:

- Auto-arranges tables in your exact preferred layout instantly
- Lets you create different layouts for different session types (8-table grind, 25-table Sunday, satellite layout)
- Eliminates gaps between tables to maximize screen space
- Includes built-in RNG and customizable hotkeys

Create 3-4 layouts before your session: primary grind, Sunday special, late-stage, and satellite layout. One click transforms your setup.

**Party Caption: See What Matters**

Your ability to make correct decisions deteriorates when you can't quickly process key information. Party Caption fixes this with color-coded stack sizes:

- Red: Short stacks (typically <20bb)
- Yellow: Medium stacks (20-40bb)
- Green: Deep stacks (40bb+)

Add HUD elements that help decisions: effective stack size, stack after action (see SPR on next street), buy-in amount (prevents expensive misclicks), time until blinds increase, distance to money/pay jumps. Hide casino promotions and other distractions. Make bounties huge and color-coded in PKO tournaments.

**Gyazo: Capture Spots for Study**

Don't break focus during sessions trying to analyze complex spots. Use Gyazo (free) to screenshot interesting situations instantly. After your session, you'll have 20-40 marked hands ready for review. This separates playing from studying—both get done better when done separately.

### Master Hand Review with CheckDecide

CheckDecide transforms hand history review from tedious to efficient. Instead of clicking through every hand you played, it filters to show only meaningful decisions.

**How to use it:**

1. **Upload hands instantly**: Open your poker client's hand history folder, press Control+A to select all hands, copy, paste into CheckDecide. Takes 30 seconds.

2. **Apply intermediate filters**: This displays every blind you defended or folded, every premium hand you folded (AJ+, 66+, suited broadways), every significant pot you played. This typically reduces 200+ hands to 30-40 meaningful decisions.

3. **Use passive view for solo review**: Click through hands rapidly, noting spots that feel uncomfortable or unclear.

4. **Add notes for coaching**: Type comments directly on hands—"Too loose?" or "Should I fold to this 3-bet?" Your coach sees your questions and responds in-line.

5. **Test yourself with active view**: When reviewing another player's hands, CheckDecide hides their action and asks what YOU would do. This trains pattern recognition far better than passive watching.

### Use HRC for Push-Fold Precision

HRC (Hold'em Resources Calculator) runs millions of simulations to calculate optimal shoving and calling ranges based on exact tournament conditions. It accounts for stack sizes, blind levels, payout structures (ICM), and opponent tendencies.

**For basic chip EV spots:**

1. Open HRC, select "Advanced Monte Carlo"
2. Choose "Chip EV in big blinds"
3. Enter stack sizes in big blinds (always use BBs, not chip counts)
4. Input blinds and antes
5. Set up the action tree: typically "2x open, 8bb 3-bet, all-in 4-bet"

The color-coded grid shows profitability: darker green = highly profitable shove, red = losing play.

**Critical insight**: Don't blindly follow HRC's default ranges. The solver assumes your opponent plays perfectly. They don't. You must adjust.

**Adjusting opponent ranges:**

- **Against tight players**: Remove their loose shoves from the range. If villain never ships Q4s, delete those hands. Re-run the sim. Your calling range will tighten, but your EV with premium hands increases.

- **Against maniacs**: Add more bluffs to their 3-bet range. Re-run. Your shoving range narrows (they're calling wider), but you can call lighter.

- **The 5% rule**: As a default against unknown opponents, only take spots that show at least +0.25 EV. If you have a skill edge post-flop, tighten this to +0.40. If you're outclassed, lower it to +0.10.

**For ICM situations:**

1. Select "Balmith Harville ICM" instead of Chip EV
2. Enter exact payout structure
3. Input all player stacks

Even when button opens 82% of hands, small blind often can't profitably shove any two cards because of ICM pressure. The math is counterintuitive—verify it in HRC rather than guessing.

**Testing multiple scenarios**: Don't run one sim and call it done. Test three versions: GTO vs GTO (equilibrium baseline), villain too tight (remove bottom of their range), villain too loose (add more bluffs). Compare results to understand how strategy shifts based on opponent type.

### Build Understanding with PioSolver

PioSolver is your microscope for examining poker situations with mathematical precision. But most players either avoid it entirely or drown in its complexity without extracting actionable insights.

**The Analysis Mindset**

Don't get lost in individual frequencies. You're hunting for patterns: When does the solver prefer small bets? What range characteristics trigger aggressive play? How does strategy shift when board texture changes? Extract principles, not memorized lines.

**Building Your Foundation: Tree Construction**

Start with the out-of-position range since it's typically wider. For big blind defense, click 100% then remove hands you'd fold. Add 3-bet candidates separately. Save your ranges by position and depth—label them clearly: "BB vs CO 40bb."

For bet sizes, use four sizes on the flop: minbet (20%), small (35%), large (75%), overbet (120%). On turn and river, use 33%, 77%, and 120%, with "add all-in" checked on river.

**Running Effective Simulations**

Input your board, confirm pot size and effective stacks. Accuracy standards:
- 0.5% exploitability: Quick checks
- 0.3% exploitability: Serious analysis
- 0.1% exploitability: Critical spots

Always press **STOP** before analyzing. If you don't stop the solve, you're viewing garbage data while it continues computing.

**Extracting Actionable Insights**

After solving, use Range Explorer to see range composition percentages. On Q♦6♣2♠ rainbow:
- Out-of-position: 36% complete air, 29% weak pairs (65% trash)
- In-position: 20% air, significant set/overpair advantage
- Result: In-position can use aggressive small sizing

The pattern: Heavy air concentration + no draws = small bet frequency increases.

**Node-Locking for Exploitation**

Press **Control+N** to open node-lock options. Make realistic adjustments: pure fold all the hands your opponent actually folds. Re-run the solve and watch strategy shift dramatically. This is where Pio becomes profitable—you're solving for *your opponent's actual strategy*, not some theoretically perfect player.

**Advanced Analysis with Hotness**

Press Control+H after reaching the turn, select "Strategy." This shows how strategy changes across all turn cards—a pattern recognition gold mine. Notice solver bets smallest on king turns (your check-raised top pair just got counterfeited) but large on low cards (your two-pair/set combos remain nutted).

### Set Up Simple Preflop for ICM Analysis

Most players who own ICM solvers never use them correctly. Here's the right workflow:

**Initial Setup:**
- Always use 100bb as your big blind baseline
- Configure bet sizes: 25%/50%/all-in for flop/turn; 50%/75%/overbet for river
- Set preflop raise size (typically 2.2x) and 3-bet size (typically 3.65x)
- Use 3 max players for multiway spots—saves computation time

**Critical Tree Verification**

Before running any sim, manually check the game tree:
- When UTG shoves 6bb, does hijack have realistic options?
- Did you include small blind limping options? Add them manually
- After small blind limps, can big blind raise? Add that option
- After big blind raises small blind limp, can small blind reshove?

Many sim sellers get lazy here. Always verify your tree is realistic.

**Color Removal and ICM Setup**

When setting up an ICM sim where UTG and hijack fold, don't leave their ranges at 100%. Give folding players realistic opening ranges (44% for UTG, slightly wider for HJ). This accounts for card removal effects—proper card removal affects ranges by 5-10%, which is massive in close ICM spots.

### Train Deliberately with Bots

Specialized software lets you play preflop situations repeatedly against equilibrium opponents, providing immediate feedback.

**How to execute it:**

1. **Focus on specific scenarios**: Isolate situations like "button opens 25bb effective, I'm in the big blind" and play 100 consecutive hands. This repetition builds pattern recognition.

2. **Verbalize your reasoning before deciding**: Say out loud: "He's covered, so I defend 75%, and K4o is in that range because..." When you're wrong, you immediately see the gap.

3. **Note your error patterns**: After 100 hands, review what you got wrong. You're overfolding weak Kx? Not 3-bet shoving enough suited broadway? These patterns are your study roadmap.

4. **Build from coverage to standard stacks**: Start with scenarios where stack-to-pot ratios create clear decisions, then gradually add ICM pressure.

### Exploit Population Tendencies

**The Check-Raise Defense Gap**

When you call a check-raise in position on a low board, the out-of-position player faces a brutal turn defense problem that most players butcher. After check-raising the flop aggressively (say, 7-high boards), the big blind has a range full of made 7x but also lots of air bluffs. When you call and a brick turns, they're supposed to continue 70%+ against a small bet—but most players only continue their value hands.

**How to exploit it:**

1. Call check-raises wider than you think—even hands that seem marginal become profitable calls because of poor turn defense
2. Probe the turn with small sizing (33-50% pot)—you're targeting the A5o, K8o, and missed draws they check-raised with
3. Be relentless on bricks—when the turn is a complete blank, your small bet prints chips against overfolds

**Other population patterns:**

- **Underbluffing on later streets**: Solvers show villain should blast river with all their KJ, QJ, T9s type hands. Reality? They check back unless they have Qx+. This means your thin value hands print money.

- **3-betting too tight from big blind**: Most players only shove premium pairs. This means: call wider facing raises, bluff more rivers, don't pay off their aggression lightly.

- **Massive overfolding to aggression**: Look for any spot where optimal play requires defending "air"—most players won't.

## Practical Examples

**The EV calculation that changes perspective:**

Low-stakes player (\$50 ABI on Monday):
- Plays 25 tournaments
- 10% ROI (fields are tougher on weekdays)
- 4-hour session
- **EV: \$125**

Same player on Sunday:
- Plays 60 tournaments
- \$150 ABI (takes shots by selling action)
- 25% ROI (softer fields)
- 8-hour session
- **EV: \$2,250**

That's **18x higher expected value**. Even if these estimates are 50% off, Sunday is still 9x more valuable than Monday.

**The study cycle:**

Sunday night: Save 23 hands in your tracking software where you were uncertain.

Monday: Rest day. Don't force poker.

Tuesday evening: Open first five hands. Run in solver. Post in Discord study group: "How wide should I be defending BB vs SB open at 20bb effective in PKO?"

Wednesday morning: Review responses, run additional scenarios, update your default strategy.

Thursday: Repeat with five more hands.

Friday-Saturday: Final review of key concepts, watch one advanced video on your weakest area.

Sunday: You're now prepared for those exact spots when they arise with \$5,000 on the line.

**The 7-2-2 Rainbow Flop**

Situation: 25bb effective, button opens, you defend 97s in the big blind. Flop 7♥2♦2♠, villain bets 33% pot.

Solver analysis: You should check-raise 83% of your 7x. Your bluffs are two-card-to-seven hands with backdoor equity: 86s, T9s, J9s. You're using a small raise to fold out KJo, QTo, and similar hands.

Population adjustment: When you execute this and villain calls with hands like KJo (where solver shows a fold), attack the turn aggressively with small bets. The Q♣ hits, you check, they bet 50% pot—they're bluffing too much because they don't understand they're supposed to fold these hands on the flop.

**Training Big Blind Defense at 25bb**

Observation: After 100 hands of training, you notice you got 4 wrong—all from overfolding weak offsuit hands.

The pattern: You folded J5o and thought "weak jack, easy fold." The solver shows you defend 85% when covered because villain opens so tight. J5o is comfortably in that range.

The lesson: At short stacks with coverage, "weak for your range" means something different. Your instincts from deeper stacks don't apply.
